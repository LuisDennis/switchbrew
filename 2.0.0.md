## Kernel

  - KPoolManager was completely rewritten.

<!-- end list -->

  - KHandleTable default size was improved from 40 to 1024.
  - The code to create a bigger handle table in allocated pool memory
    has been removed.
  - KHandleTable spinlock was given core-suspension logic.
  - KHandleTable compresses 64-bit pointers into 32-bit offsets.

<!-- end list -->

  - KAddressSpace was renamed to KDeviceAddressSpace.

<!-- end list -->

  - KSharedMemory now doesn't incref for each map.
      - Instead it maintains a list of every map (each 0x20-byte entry).
      - Probably to do better cleanup.

<!-- end list -->

  - KInterruptEvent changed:
      - Creation doesn't use KIrqSingleton directly anymore.
      - Instead it allocates a 0x20-byte entry, and then uses
        KIrqSingleton.
      - Probaly to do better cleanup.

<!-- end list -->

  - Size-checks \>= 0x180000000 was added to a bunch of syscalls.

<!-- end list -->

  - Restriction on debug SVCs were loosened to support
    [creport](Creport.md "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - svcReadWriteRegister was extended with more registers.

<!-- end list -->

  - Added blacklist on [NPDM](NPDM.md "wikilink") kernel descriptor
    memory mappings.

<!-- end list -->

  - Process exception dispatching was implemented/improved.

<!-- end list -->

  - Support for processes with 39-bit AddressSpaceType was added.
      - Includes required IPC changes.
