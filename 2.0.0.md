## Kernel

  - KPoolManager was majorly rewritten.
      - Added MAC crypto on heap-chunk headers, to protect against DMA
        attacks (same as 3DS).

<!-- end list -->

  - KHandleTable default size was improved from 40 to 1024.
  - The code to create a bigger handle table in allocated pool memory
    has been removed.
  - KHandleTable spinlock was given core-suspension logic.
  - KHandleTable compresses 64-bit pointers into 32-bit offsets.

<!-- end list -->

  - KAddressSpace was renamed to KDeviceAddressSpace.

<!-- end list -->

  - KSharedMemory now maintains a list of every map (each 0x20-byte
    entry).
      - To do cleanup of mapped shared memories when a process is
        killed.

<!-- end list -->

  - KSharedMemory no longer references the owning KProcess.
      - Instead it stores the pid, so that the process can be freed even
        though the shared memory still exists.

<!-- end list -->

  - KInterruptEvent changed:
      - Creation doesn't use KIrqSingleton directly anymore.
      - Instead it allocates a 0x20-byte entry, and then uses
        KIrqSingleton.
      - Probaly to do better cleanup.

<!-- end list -->

  - Size-checks \>= 0x180000000 was added to a bunch of syscalls.

<!-- end list -->

  - Restriction on debug SVCs were loosened to support
    [creport](Creport.md "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - svcReadWriteRegister was extended with more registers.

<!-- end list -->

  - Added blacklist on [NPDM](NPDM.md "wikilink") kernel descriptor
    memory mappings.

<!-- end list -->

  - svcGetInfo was extended with more id0's.

<!-- end list -->

  - Process exception dispatching was implemented/improved.

<!-- end list -->

  - Support for processes with 39-bit AddressSpaceType was added.
      - Includes required IPC changes.

<!-- end list -->

  - On startup, kernel now calls SMC id1 0xC3000007 with the kernel
    memory range start and size.

<!-- end list -->

  - AArch64 exception vector for "SError interrupt" was implemented.

<!-- end list -->

  - Kernel stacks are now allocated with a slabheap.
