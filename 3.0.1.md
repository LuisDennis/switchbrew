## Change-log

[Official](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/p/897)
ALL change-log:

  - General system stability improvements to enhance the user's
    experience, including:
  - Addressed an issue in which the remaining battery charge can't be
    displayed accurately
  - If the system's battery power display suddenly increases or
    decreases, it will gradually improve by following these steps.

## System Titles

Exactly the following was updated:

  - Every sysmodule.
  - Every web-applet.
  - Sysupdate titlelisting-title, browser "shareddata:/", [System
    Version Title](System%20Version%20Title.md "wikilink"), and all FIRM
    packages.

All sysmodules were rebuilt, where the only change was the hashid
following the "GNU" string, however some sysmodules have additional
changes.

  - Some sysmodules have strings containing
    "D:\\**h**ome\\teamcity\\work\\sdk\\Externals\\{...}" changed to
    "D:\\**H**ome\\teamcity\\work\\sdk\\Externals\\{...}".
  - Build timestamp in wlan-sysmodule was updated.

Actual updated sysmodules:

  - nvservices
  - pcv
  - account
  - nim
  - pctl
  - npns
  - eupld

The only changes for npns and account: The
"https://dauth-%.ndas.srv.nintendo.net/v1/device\_auth\_token" URL was
changed to "https://dauth-%.ndas.srv.nintendo.net/{hex
string}/device\_auth\_token".

The above new URL was added(not replacing any URL in .(ro)data) to nim,
+ code changes. A "device\_auth\_token" string in nim was removed.

As of October 19, 2017, manually accessing the above new URL with the
proper post-data works fine, however accessing the old URL returns the
following: `{"errors":[{"code":"0007","message":"System update is
required."}]}` Hence, all sysmodules using the old URL would throw a
sysupdate-required error.

### FIRM packages

819:

Everything under RomFS was updated.

Kernel wasn't updated.

The following firm-sysmodules were updated: FS, boot, and sm. The
remaining modules(Loader, NCM, ProcessMana, and spl) were rebuilt:
hashid following "GNU" string was updated.

#### [FS](Filesystem%20services.md "wikilink")

Basically all code changes are related to the new
[NCA](NCA%20Format.md "wikilink") crypto. Key-init function was updated
due to the new NCA crypto. Various keyindex values were updated due to
the new NCA crypto, for non-NCA and NCA code. A function which returned
ncahdr\_x206("Crypto Type") was replaced with a branch to the new
<get-final-cryptotype> function described
[here](NCA%20Format.md "wikilink")(equivalent to similar changes
elsewhere).

#### boot

Updated 1 func and added a new func:

  - Added a call to <new func>. w1 value passed to L\_381c(prev ver
    L\_37d4) is now the output of <mask>, instead of fixed to 0x1.

## Internet Browser
