Security flaws fixed: <fill this in manually later, see the updatedetails page from the ninupdates-report page(s) once available for now>.

==Change-log==
[http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/p/897 Official] ALL change-log:

'''General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience, including:'''
* Addressed an issue in which the remaining battery charge can't be displayed accurately 
** If the system's battery power display suddenly increases or decreases, it will gradually improve by [http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/27111 following these steps].

==System Titles==
Exactly the following was updated:
* Every sysmodule.
* Every web-applet.
* Sysupdate titlelisting-title, browser "shareddata:/", [[System Version Title]], and all FIRM packages.

All sysmodules were rebuilt, where the only change was the hashid following the "GNU" string, however some sysmodules have additional changes.
* Some sysmodules have strings containing "D:\'''h'''ome\teamcity\work\sdk\Externals\{...}" changed to "D:\'''H'''ome\teamcity\work\sdk\Externals\{...}".
* Build timestamp in wlan-sysmodule was updated.

Actual updated sysmodules:
* nvservices
* pcv
* account
* nim
* pctl
* npns
* eupld

The only changes for npns and account: The <nowiki>"https://dauth-%.ndas.srv.nintendo.net/v1/device_auth_token"</nowiki> URL was changed to <nowiki>"https://dauth-%.ndas.srv.nintendo.net/{hex string}/device_auth_token"</nowiki>.

The above new URL was added(not replacing any URL in .(ro)data) to nim, + code changes. A "device_auth_token" string in nim was removed.

As of October 19, 2017, manually accessing the above new URL with the proper post-data works fine, however accessing the old URL returns the following: <code>{"errors":[{"code":"0007","message":"System update is required."}]}</code>
Hence, all sysmodules using the old URL would throw a sysupdate-required error.

===FIRM packages===
819:

Everything under RomFS was updated.

Kernel wasn't updated.

The following firm-sysmodules were updated: FS, boot, and sm. The remaining modules(Loader, NCM, ProcessMana, and spl) were rebuilt: hashid following "GNU" string was updated.

Basically all code changes are related to the new [[NCA_Format|NCA]] crypto. Key-init function was updated due to the new NCA crypto. Various keyindex values were updated due to the new NCA crypto, for non-NCA and NCA code. A function which returned ncahdr_x206("Crypto Type") was replaced with a branch to the new <get-final-cryptotype> function described [[NCA_Format|here]](equivalent to similar changes elsewhere).

====boot====
Updated 1 func and added a new func:
* Added a call to <new func>. w1 value passed to L_381c(prev ver L_37d4) is now the output of <mask>, instead of fixed to 0x1.
