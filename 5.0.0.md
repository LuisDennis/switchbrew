## System Titles

All 01000000000010XX titles and most 01000000000008XX titles were
updated. Some 8XX titles were just rebuilt with the new NCA crypto
without actual RomFS-content changes.

  - 0100000000000824(Mariko Config), 0100000000000825, 0100000000000826
    were added.
      - 0100000000000824 provides configuration for the new "T214" SoC.
      - 0100000000000825 contains an empty "/blacklist.dat" file.
      - 0100000000000826 contains a 0x40-byte "/version" file, this is
        all-zero except for '0' at offset 0x20.

The only 8XX titles with actual changes are (besides sysver-title, see
below for FIRM):

  - 801 (Support Error Codes)
  - 803 (web-applet "shareddata:/")
  - 804 (HTML resources for "Intellectual Property Notices" / "Health &
    Safety Information")
      - "/legallines.htdocs/index.html" was updated with a Twitter
        mention, and a license section for "Software License for The
        Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android" was added.
      - "/safe.htdocs/html/EU{XX}/index.html" was updated.
  - 806 (Bad words)
  - 807 ([Hotspot List](Hotspot%20List.md "wikilink"))
      - This was updated with more hotspots (these networks use
        encryption): "nintendoappdebug1", "Nintendo App Debug2",
        "Nintendo App Debug3", and "NCL-NZSERVICE1-5GHZ".
  - 80A (Chara)
  - 80B (Offline news)
  - 80E (Geo Zoneinfo)
  - 810-814 (All fonts)

      - "/lyt/ColorTable" and "/lyt/footer/controllerIcon.bntx" were
        updated. The "01-00" image showing handheld-mode with detached
        joy-cons was replaced with a blank image.
  - 81F (Icosa system config)
  - 820 (Copper system config)
  - 821 (Hoag system config)
  - 822 (Firmware binaries for peripherals)
      - The following was updated: "FirmwareInfo.csv", "tera\_ota.bin",
        "tera\_ota\_iap.bin", and "ukyosakyo\_ep2\_ota.bin".
  - 823

The built codebins now have padding in .text after every function for
0x10-byte alignment (and other compiler changes).

The SDK included with titles (main-codebin) for NV changed/updated
NVIDIA hw strings:

### FIRM

All FIRM titles were updated, and everything under RomFS was updated.

A new folder "a" was added, in addition to the existing "nx" folder,
containing a separate "bct" and "package1". Both of these seem
encrypted/meant for the new "Mariko" hardware that support was added
for.

The following firm-sysmodules was added to both safemode-firm, which
were originally in separate sysmodule-titles:
[Bus](Bus%20services.md "wikilink"),
[PCV](PCV%20services.md "wikilink"), and
[psc](PSC%20services.md "wikilink").

#### Secure Monitor

The [Memory layout](Memory%20layout.md "wikilink") was changed
significantly:

  - .text, .rodata, and .data are now separate sections, mapped with
    correct permissions (RX, RO, RW, respectively), instead of being
    mapped RWX.
  - Physical layout in TZRAM changed significantly, with pk2ldr being in
    low TZRAM instead of high TZRAM, etc.

In addition, there were changes to the [SMC](SMC.md "wikilink")
interface:

  - smcGenerateSpecificAesKey was updated to support generating previous
    4.x+ device key(s).
  - smcLoadSecureExpModKey/smcLoadRsaOaepKey/smcDecryptRsaPrivateKey no
    longer exist.
  - smcLoadRsaOaepKey was replaced with
    smcEncryptRsaPrivateKeyForImport.
  - smcDecryptRsaPrivateKey was replaced with
    smcDecryptOrImportRsaPrivateKey.
      - All keys which were previously imported with specific keys now
        first call smcEncryptRsaPrivateKeyForImport with the appopriate
        enum member to get a sealed copy of the RSA key, then
        smcDecryptOrImportRsaPrivateKey to import/unseal the key when
        needed.
  - smcGetConfig was extended with two new config items:
      - GetConfig(16), which seems to check whether the Switch is
        running on a Tegra
210:

`   return (FUSE_RESERVED_ODM4 & 0x800) &&  FUSE_RESERVED_ODM0 == 0x8E61ECAE &&  FUSE_RESERVED_ODM1  == 0xF2BA3BB2 ?  (FUSE_RESERVED_ODM2 & 0x1F) : 0`

  -   - Getconfig(17), which returns the Package2 meta fields (first 4
        words) if package2 is plaintext.

<fill in the rest later>

#### Kernel

  - Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization was added.
      - Instead of using a hardcoded address for per-CPU region, they
        now use x18 to point to the per-CPU region.
  - When using most [SMCs](SMC.md "wikilink"), IRQs are now disabled
    first then restored to original state afterwards. x18 is also
    reinitialized right after most SMCs (see above).
  - 5 new syscalls.
      - Syscalls 0x48+0x49 are used by
        [AM](AM%20services.md "wikilink")-sysmodule.
      - Syscall 0x4A is used by
        [PM](Process%20Manager%20services.md "wikilink")-sysmodule.
      - Syscall 0x6F is used by FS, SM, and PM.
  - NPDM irq\_id's are no longer checked to be \< 0x100, instead
    max-value is loaded from per-cpu state.
  - The order slabheaps are laid out in memory is now randomized.

### [Internet Browser](Internet%20Browser.md "wikilink")

OSS/WebKit was updated.

In the [NPDM](NPDM.md "wikilink"), besides the RSA region the only
changes were the kernel-release-version descriptor + {new ACID flag is
set}.

In the "shareddata:/" title, the NROs are now compressed:
"{name}.nro.lz4" instead of "{name}.nro".

### [qlaunch](Qlaunch.md "wikilink")

RomFS changes:

  - "/common/shader/VarietyOceanShader\_Nx.arc.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/common.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/DummyGameA.szs" and "/lyt/DummyGame.szs" were removed.
  - "/lyt/Entrance.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Eula.szs" added
  - "/lyt/Flaunch.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Gift.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Interrupt.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Migration.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Notification.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Option.szs"
  - "/lyt/ResidentMenu.szs"
  - "/lyt/Set.szs"
  - "/message/" Everything under here was updated.
  - "/message/Ocean.msbp.szs" added
  - "/sound/qlaunch\_action.bksnd" and "/sound/qlaunch.bfsar" were
    updated.
  - "/texture" Directory was added, which contains images for Nintendo
    Switch Parental Controls:
      - "IcoPctl.bntx"
      - "LogoMoon{region/language-text}.bntx", for every
        region/language.

## [NPDM](NPDM.md "wikilink")

New flags bit2/bit3 were added to the flags at ACID+0xC.

## Keys

[Keyblob](Flash%20Filesystem.md "wikilink") 5 is now used, instead of 4.
New NCA keydata is now used as well.
