## System Titles

\<fill this in (manually) later\>

  - 0100000000000824(Mariko Config), 0100000000000825, 0100000000000826
    were added.
      - 0100000000000824 provides configuration for the new "T214" SoC.
      - 0100000000000825 contains an empty "/blacklist.dat" file.
      - 0100000000000826 contains a 0x40-byte "/version" file, this is
        all-zero except for '0' at offset 0x20.

The built codebins now have padding in .text after every function for
0x10-byte alignment.

### FIRM

Everything under RomFS was updated.

A new folder "a" was added, in addition to the existing "nx" folder,
containing a separate "bct" and "package1". Both of these seem
encrypted/meant for the new "Mariko" hardware that support was added
for.

The following firm-sysmodules was added to both safemode-firm, which
were originally in separate sysmodule-titles:
[Bus](Bus%20services.md "wikilink"),
[PCV](PCV%20services.md "wikilink"), and
[psc](PSC%20services.md "wikilink").

All firm-sysmodules were updated (might be due to updated (?) rtld).

#### Secure Monitor

The [Memory layout](Memory%20layout.md "wikilink") was changed
significantly:

  - .text, .rodata, and .data are now separate sections, instead of
    being mapped RWX.
  - Physical layout in TZRAM changed significantly, with pk2ldr being in
    low TZRAM instead of high TZRAM.

In addition, there were changes to the SMC interface:

  - smcLoadSecureExpModKey no longer exists.
  - smcLoadRsaOaepKey has been replaced with a new SMC (0xC300D60C) that
    loads two keys into TrustZone.
  - smcGetConfig was extended with two new config items:
  - \-GetConfig(16) now does the following, which seems to check whether
    the Switch is running on a Tegra
210:

`   return (FUSE_RESERVED_ODM4 & 0x800) &&  FUSE_RESERVED_ODM0 == 0x8E61ECAE &&  FUSE_RESERVED_ODM1  == 0xF2BA3BB2 ?  (FUSE_RESERVED_ODM2 & 0x1F) : 0`

  - Getconfig(17) now checks whether package2 is plaintext or encrypted.

<fill in the rest later>

#### Kernel

  - Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization was added.
      - Instead of using a hardcoded address for per-CPU region, they
        now use x18 to point to the per-CPU region.
  - 6 new syscalls

### [Internet Browser](Internet%20Browser.md "wikilink")

OSS/WebKit was updated.

In the [NPDM](NPDM.md "wikilink"), besides the RSA region the only
changes were the kernel-release-version descriptor + {new ACID flag is
set}.

### [qlaunch](Qlaunch.md "wikilink")

RomFS changes:

  - "/common/shader/VarietyOceanShader\_Nx.arc.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/common.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/DummyGameA.szs" and "/lyt/DummyGame.szs" were removed.
  - "/lyt/Entrance.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Eula.szs" added
  - "/lyt/Flaunch.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Gift.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Interrupt.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Migration.szs" updated
  - "/lyt/Notification.szs" updated

  - "/sound/qlaunch\_action.bksnd" and "/sound/qlaunch.bfsar" were
    updated.
  - "/texture" Directory was added, which contains:
      - "IcoPctl.bntx"
      - "LogoMoon{region/language-text}.bntx", for every
        region/language.

## [NPDM](NPDM.md "wikilink")

New flags bit2/bit3 were added to the flags at ACID+0xC.

## Keys

[Keyblob](Flash%20Filesystem.md "wikilink") 5 is now used, instead of 4.
