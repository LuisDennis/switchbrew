## System Titles

\<fill this in (manually) later\>

System-config / IcosaMariko system-config was updated, however this was
just a rebuild (nothing in NCA header changed besides
signature+keyarea).

### FIRM

Only FIRM titles that use FS ([FS](Filesystem%20services.md "wikilink"),
[NCM](NCM%20services.md "wikilink"), [Boot](Boot.md "wikilink"),
[Loader](Loader%20services.md "wikilink") and
[PM](Process%20Manager%20services.md "wikilink")) were updated. This was
solely due to the new cmd 1010 in FS.
