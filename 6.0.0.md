## System Titles

  - All sysmodules were updated.
  - Most 8XX titles were updated.
  - All applets except "error" and "cabinet" were updated.
  - 1 new title was added: olsc-sysmodule.
  - New services were added, see [here](Services%20API.md "wikilink").

### [USB-sysmodule](USB%20services.md "wikilink")

The only sysmodule with any changes for accessible IO in the
[NPDM](NPDM.md "wikilink") was USB-sysmodule. The IO page for the [fuse
registers](Fuses.md "wikilink") is now accessible by this sysmodule.

### olsc-sysmodule

This new sysmodule handles cloud saves.

### FIRM

#### Secure Monitor

Changes were made relating to security engine usage:

  - Many functions which previously used an inline GetSecurityEngine()
    call to get the security engine register address now take in a
    register base as an argument. This is presumably to facilitate moved
    Security Engine MMIO on the Mariko SoC.
  - Keyslots 0-8, 0xA, 0xC-0xE now have flags 0x1FF set, and keyslot 0xB
    now additionally has flags 0x17F set.
  - The Test Vector used to ensure keyslot contents do not change during
    wake-from-sleep now uses 256-bit AES instead of 128-bit AES (thus
    the high parts of the keyslot contents are now verified).

Some changes were made to initial SoC setup:

  - Additional magic numbers (0x83 = SKU ID, 0x2 = ?, 0x210 = Tegra 210)
    are now written into the GPU microcode in DRAM for runtime
    configuration.
  - The warmboot firmware's firmware revision magic was changed from 0x6
    to 0x87.
  - The GPU microcode carveout setup was moved to later during
    initialization (after package2 has been fully loaded and verified).
  - The IRAM addresses from which [BootConfig](BootConfig.md "wikilink")
    warmboot firmware are loaded were changed.

In addition, there were changes to the [SMC](SMC.md "wikilink")
interface:

  - SMCs which take in a keyslot parameter have been changed to allow
    use of up to 6 keyslots instead of 4.
  - smcUnwrapRsaOaepWrappedTitleKey now takes in a "type" parameter, and
    the kek used in key generation is now selected from an array based
    on this parameter. (smcUnwrapAesWrappedTitlekey hardcodes type 0.)
  - GetConfig(HardwareType) now returns 4 when it previously would have
    returned 3.

Additionally, security flaws were addressed in smcCpuSuspend (aiming to
further mitigate jamais vu/deja vu):

  - The number of devices checked to be held in reset at the time of
    smcCpuSuspend is called is now greatly increased.
  - BPMP SC7 Entry Firmware is now only started *after* the following
    have been done, instead of before:
      - TZRAM contents have been encrypted and MAC'd with a random
        AES-256 key
      - The PMC scratch registers where the MAC are stored have been
        verified not to be read or write-locked.
      - The MAC is written into the PMC scratch registers, which are
        then write-locked.
      - The PMC scratch registers are verified to have been
        write-locked.
      - The PMC scratch registers are verified to contain the MAC TZ has
        written into them.
      - The PMC scratch registers are read-locked.
      - The PMC scratch registers are verified to be both read and
        write-locked.
      - The BPMP's firmware is copied from TZRAM into IRAM
      - memcmp(BPMP firmware in IRAM, BPMP firmware in TZRAM,
        sizeof(BPMP firmware)) is verified to be zero.

#### Kernel

  - Accidentially exported symbols have been renamed:
      - Namespace `nn::kern::ARM64` is now `nn::kern::arch::ARM64`
      - Namespace `nn::kern::NX` is now `nn::kern::board::NX` and now
        contains the class `KSystemControl`
      - `ResumeEntry` is now a non-static method of `KSystemControl`
  - Kernel now reserves 1024 pages (1MB) of memory in SYSTEM
    memregion/pool for use by applets (1 at a time) for personal mmheap.
  - Memory regions arrange changed, APPLET has 6MB less in all memory
    arranges.
  - Maximum number of sessions and events both increased by 100.
  - Kernel mmheap size decreased to 0x10DF000 bytes (was 0x1117000), the
    both KMemoryBlock pools' capacity is unchanged, but less page tables
    can be allocated.
  - Kernel now properly reports DRAM size in default reslimit.
  - Two new svcGetInfoTypes: types 21 and 22. These are like type 6 and
    7, but without the contiguous, in-security-carveout, personalmmheap
    allocation.
  - KASLR was changed to invoke smcGetRandomBytes(8) each time, instead
    of using Mersenne Twister.
  - Another layer of randomization has been added to slabheaps (before,
    it was just the order of slabheaps): an array of N (= 21 = number of
    slabheaps) random integers, in range (0, 0x200000) is now
    constructed, sorted via bubble sort; at each slabheap construction
    the heap offset is further incremented by `array[id+1]-array[id]` ,
    then page rounded.
  - With the exception of KSessionRequest which is not in any
    KObjectAllocator, all KAutoObject types now use an intrusive rbtree
    instead of an intrusive list for their KObjectAllocator membership.
    Comparison key is PID for processes, thread ID for threads, address
    for others (using a new virtual method).
  - A new anonymous KAutoObject type, which sole purpose is to hold a
    comparison key, is now used for thread lookup by ID.
  - Breaking changes in svcGetFutureThreadInfo, which has potentially
    been renamed. Signature and use case have radically changed, it is
    now: `Result svcGetFutureThreadInfo(ThreadInfo *outThreadInfo, u64
    *outTid, Handle debugHandle, s64 timeout)`.
  - Huge scheduler force-pause and last thread reporting refactor:
      - Scheduling flags are now u16 and force-pause flags are
        3-nibble-long instead of 1.
      - The requirements and mechanism for force-pausing (activity svc,
        debug, etc.) threads have been considerably simplified:
          - It used to delay the force-pause after end-of-svc, and used
            some convoluted mechanism.
          - The condition is now "a thread is force-pausable iff no
            thread is waiting for a kernel mutex it is holding",
            mechanism is just ORRing scheduling status with force-pause
            flags now. Appropriate changes have been made to accomodate
            for this change.
          - Abovementionned convoluted mechanism has been refactored,
            too, but remains unused.
      - When the scheduler selects a process's thread, it now stored the
        selected thread in an array in the KProcess, for information. It
        also stores in itself and in array in the selected KProcess the
        number of times it detected a core being idle before load
        balancing. Used by BreakDebugProcess.  

<!-- end list -->

  - All threads created and started in kernel main() are started
    force-paused with flags=0x100. This fixes the hypotetical case where
    a compromised KIP would perform gmmuhax and dump the INI1 (which is
    stored in APPLICATION -- KIPs are only started after all of them
    have been loaded). They are unpaused after all KIPs have been
    created.
  - GetThreadContext3 (unprivileged SVC) now dumps TPIDR\_EL0.
  - DebugActiveProcess now returns 0xFA01 if an attempt to debug the
    current process is made -- instead of possibly deadlocking
  - GetDebugThreadContext and SetDebugThreadContext now return 0xF001 if
    flags \> 15. Additionally, their functionality is now restricted to
    threads that have been force-paused for debug, not just any kind of
    force-paused threads anymore.
  - ContinueDebugEvent now returns 0xF001 if flags \> 15 as well.
  - svcSleepSystem has been refactored. Instead of the initiator thread
    manually starting the sleep handler threads then storing a weak
    reference to itself, the handler threads are started in kernel init
    in main() immediately after their creation, and two mutexes are
    used: one for the initiator/covering svcSleepSystem, another for the
    handler threads. This likely fixes an UaF or race condition.
  - If svcReturnFromException passes the exception the KDebug, ie. if
    the argument errorCode is not 0, and if the latter has
    DontCatchExceptions set, the process is terminated (unless errorCode
    is 0x10001).
  - Performance improvements to svcInvalidateProcessDataCache.
