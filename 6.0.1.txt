==Change-log==
[https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/p/897 Official] ALL change-log:
* General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience, including:
* 	Resolved an issue where internet connection test does not display correct results for download and upload speed
* 	Resolved an issue where some licensed controllers' motion controls such as tilt function respond incorrectly

==System Titles==
Besides [[System Version Title]], the following titles were updated:

* [[HID_services|hid-sysmodule]]
* [[Audio_services|audio-sysmodule]]
* [[qlaunch]]

Nothing changed in the content of the updated titles' RomFS besides [[System Version Title]]. Nothing changed sysmodule-side with IPC. No actual changes in [[NPDM]]s.

=== [[Audio_services|audio-sysmodule]] ===
There was exactly 1 code change: in L_1bf50 (nn::audio::server::InfoUpdater::UpdateMixes), code was added for setting a certain variable to 0x1, located immediately before the following already existing code: <code>if(someval)aforementioned_variable |= somefunc(...);</code>

This appears to be a simple bugfix to correct changes introduced in 6.0.0 to the value of IsSplitterSupported.
