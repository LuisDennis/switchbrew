The Switch 6.2.0 system update was released on November 19, 2018. This
Switch update was released for the following regions: ALL.

Security flaws fixed: Yes

This update burns an additional fuse and has a fuse count of 8.

6.2.0 changes fundamental key generation, no longer using keyblobs at
all (the OS will boot successfully even if both copies of keyblob are
replaced with FFs in
NAND).

## Change-log

[Official](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/p/897)
ALL change-log:

  - General system stability improvements to enhance the user's
    experience.

## FIRM

#### NX\_BOOTLOADER

NX bootloader was updated, and is now stored compressed. Before
executing, a small stub now uncompresses the bootloader to 0x40004000,
size 0x1C000.

\[more details to be filled in later\].

#### Secure Monitor

The Secure Monitor was updated:

  - BootReason is now saved before security engine/warmboot firmware
    setup.
  - The SYSCTR0 registers are now validated to contain expected values
    on bootup.
  - generate\_srk() is now called before any other security engine key
    derivation is done.
  - Code was added to implement new key gen inside
    initialize\_se\_derive\_keys(), deriving the firmware's master kek
    and device key using keyslots initialized by the TSEC firmware.
  - Keyslots were shuffled around, the master key is now stored inside
    keyslot 0xD, and the device master key is now stored inside keyslot
    0xC.
  - The usual code changes for adding a new master key/device master key
    are in place.

There are zero changes to code outside of the coldboot .init section
(pk2ldr).

#### Kernel

  - Kernel was not updated.

#### FIRM Sysmodules

  - No FIRM sysmodules were updated.

#### Warmboot

The firmware revision magic was changed from 0x87 to 0xA8.

## System Titles

*All* titles were updated (including flog) except for EULA, to use the
new keydata.

The following sysmodules were updated with actual changes:

  - bcat, friends, hid, nvservices, account

Besides sysver titles and FIRM, the only titles' with changed RomFS are
web-applets, for "/.nrr/netfront.nrr" (only RSA data was changed here).

There seems to be no new service IPC commands.

  - bcat: The codebin was updated, but no strings were added/changed.
  - account: Besides .text changes: String "libcurl (nnDauth; <hex>; SDK
    6.4.0.0)" was added. The "v3-<oldhexstr>" in the dauth URLs were
    changed to "v4-<newhexstr>".
