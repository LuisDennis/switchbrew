## FIRM

All files under RomFS were updated.

#### NX\_BOOTLOADER

NX bootloader was updated, and is now stored compressed. Before
executing, a small stub now uncompresses the bootloader to 0x40004000,
size 0x1C000.

#### Secure Monitor

The Secure Monitor was updated, and is now stored compressed. Before
executing, a small stub now uncompresses the main TrustZone image to
0x7C010800 size 0xC800, and environment setup code to 0x40032000 size
0xC000.

  - The 0x100 region used for NX\_BOOTLOADER \<-\> SecureMonitor
    communications is now 0x40000000 instead of 0x40002E00.
  - Memory permissions for .rodata have been fixed, it is now correctly
    mapped R-- instead of RW-.
  - Sealed old keys are now stored in the auxilliary data page
    (0x1F01FA000) instead of in .rwdata.
      - An 0x10 block in the auxilliary page is now used for
        intermediate key derivation, instead of a block on the stack.
        This block is only memcleared once at the end, instead of after
        every time it is used.
  - TrustZone code is now cleared from IRAM before signalling to
    NX\_BOOTLOADER that the SecMon is awake.
  - A function for getting HardwareType based on fuses now returns 0xF
    whenever it would previously have returned a non-zero value.
      - This function is called by [smcGetConfig](SMC.md "wikilink")
        when ConfigItem\_HardwareType is passed in.
  - Warmboot.bin has been moved again, and is now copied from 0x4003E000
    size 0x17F0 instead of 0x4003D800 size 0x1FF0
  - Code configuring what peripherals to set secure-world only now
    assumes that the code is a retail unit.
      - GetRetailType() is still called (though result is discarded),
        this probably means they now have compile-time switches for
        retail vs dev.

#### Warmboot

  - The firmware revision magic was changed from 0xA8 to 0x129.

#### FIRM Sysmodules

All FIRM sysmodules were updated. The only FIRM sysmodules with IPC
changes were [FS](Filesystem%20services.md "wikilink"),
[pm](Process%20Manager%20services.md "wikilink"), and
[NCM](NCM%20services.md "wikilink"). Specific diffs for a few sysmodules
are below:

##### [PM](Process%20Manager%20services.md "wikilink")

Resource limit initialization was changed:

  - PM now sets the maximum number of threads creatable by sysmodules to
    0x60 instead of 0x260.
      - A [new
        command](Process%20Manager%20services#EnableAdditionalSystemThreads.md##EnableAdditionalSystemThreads "wikilink")
        was added to pm:shell to increase this limit once, on retail
        this doubles the number of threads creatable to 0xC0.

## System Titles

All titles were updated, except: "Chinese and Korean dictionaries",
"European English and Japanese dictionaries", EULA, "Blacklist URL",
"Dummy file", "Hoag system config", and flog.

  - Web-applets were updated. "/whitelist/WhitelistEc.txt" in
    LibAppletShop was updated:

    changed to "^https://(\[0-9A-Za-z\\-\]+\\.)\*nintendo\\.net(/|$)".
