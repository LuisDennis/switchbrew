## System Titles

\<fill this in (manually) later\>

Nothing changed for services IPC.

### FIRM

Only BCT+package1 were updated.

#### Secure Monitor

The Secure Monitor was updated.

  - The only change in .text (besides relative branch offsets updating)
    is that four instructions were inserted into the SMC handler.
      - When the bit in boot reason that restricts access to certain
        SMCs is set,
        [smcSecureExpMod](SMC#SecureExpMod.md##SecureExpMod "wikilink")
        is now blacklisted. Previously, only
        [smcDecryptOrImportRsaKey](SMC#DecryptOrImportRsaKey.md##DecryptOrImportRsaKey "wikilink")
        was blacklisted.
  - The only data changes were that smcSecureExpMod is now allowed to be
    called in recovery mode, and the global pointers for the TIMER,
    WAIT, and UART-A regions now default to 0 instead of their physical
    addresses.
      - The default pointer value change is not meaningful, as these are
        overwritten by initialization code before they are ever used.
