## FIRM

All files under RomFS were updated.

#### Package1ldr

package1ldr was updated. The TSEC secureboot firmware was not updated.

#### NX\_BOOTLOADER

NX bootloader was updated.

#### Secure Monitor

The Secure Monitor was updated.

  - DMA controller configuration now disables AHB-DMA from arbitration.
  - The SMC handler now checks a "is SMC allowed" bitmask against
    configuration set by NX bootloader(This just comes from bits 1-4 of
    the "attribute" field of the bootloader in BCT).
      - Nintendo can now blacklist certain SMCs from certain boot
        conditions, but since the bitmask is zero for retail firmware
        (everything is allowed) this isn't particularly meaningful.
  - smcGetConfig's "get\_memory\_configuration\_by\_bootconfig"
    implementation changed. It now calls a new function
    "get\_dram\_configuration", which returns a configuration value
    depending on the DRAM ID.
  - Code configuring what peripherals to set secure-world only no longer
    assumes that the code is a retail unit.
      - This removes what were presumed to be compile-time ifdefs for
        retail vs dev added in [7.0.0](7.0.0.md "wikilink").
  - Code responsible for configuring HiZ charger mode has changed a
    little.
      - smcCpuSuspend no longer checks hardware type when deciding
        whether to go down HiZ mode codepaths.
      - wakeup code on warmboot now checks whether HiZ mode is enabled,
        instead of unconditionally disabling it.
  - TSEC no longer has access to the kernel carveout, and TSECB now has
    access to the kernel carveout.
      - The Read/Write access levels were changed from 1 to 9, to
        facilitate this.

#### Kernel

Kernel initialization has changed significantly.

  - There is now a new loader program ("kernelldr") that runs before the
    kernel, and sets up KASLR/memory/etc. (kernelldr has its own
    .dynamic section).
  - The INI1 containing the Initial Programs is no longer its own
    section inside of [Package2](Package2.md "wikilink"). It is instead
    now embedded inside the kernel section, with kernelldr preparing it
    for the kernel.

<check back later for more detailed diffs>

#### Warmboot

  - The firmware revision magic was not changed.

#### FIRM Sysmodules

All FIRM sysmodules were updated. Specific diffs for a few sysmodules
are below \<check back later, to be updated\>:

##### [PM](Process%20Manager%20services.md "wikilink")

  - pm:shell now has a new command (9), which currently just does
    abort(). However, it looks like in a future update it will return an
    event handle of some kind.

## System Titles

  - 1 new title was added:
    [FunctionBlackList](#FunctionBlackList "wikilink").
  - All titles were updated, except for the following: dictionaries,
    UrlBlackList, PlatformConfigHoag, miiEdit, and flog.

### FunctionBlackList

This contains `/blacklist.dat` which contains 8-bytes of zeros.
