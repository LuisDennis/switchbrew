<check back later for diff>

#### Secure Monitor

The Secure Monitor was updated.

  - The SE key read disable function no longer writes zero to
    AES\_KEY\_READ\_DISABLE/RSA\_KEY\_READ\_DISABLE.
  - Functions for locking/checking PMC secure scratch now have
    additional bitmasks 0x40/0x80 for locking more secure scratch
    registers.
  - NVDEC/TSECB access to the kernel carveout was removed.
  - On suspend (SC7 Entry), SWR\_USBD\_RST is now checked, and AHB
    arbitration disable is now checked to be COP, ARC, USB, USB2.
      - This further mitigates against Deja Vu.
  - TZ/SE context save logic has been changed.
      - The context save function now first generates 16 random bytes,
        and securely saves them to scratch (using the usual
        write-writelock-check-readlock-checklocked pattern).
      - It then generates a random aes-256 key, and derives an actual
        encryption/MAC key by decrypting the random data with that key.
          - Previously, it generated a random aes-256 key and used it
            directly.
          - This prevents attacks that might coerce the usage of a
            specific aes-256 key instead of a random one.
      - Calls into the check scratch locked/lock scratch function which
        previously passed one bitmask at a time now pass multiple
          - Accordingly, the lock/check locked functions now support
            multiple bitmasks instead of single bitmasks at a time.
  - The function that initializes the SE/derives keys now sets flag
    0x100 on AES keyslots 8-15, and RSA keyslots 0-1.

#### Kernel

Kernel was not changed.

#### Warmboot

  - The firmware revision magic was changed from 0x129 to 0x14A.
  - Security Engine state validation was changed (first six keyslots now
    expected to read zeroes instead of FFs).
  - <check back for more diffs later>

#### FIRM Sysmodules

FIRM sysmodules were updated. Specific diffs available below:

##### [Boot](Boot.md "wikilink")

Only GNU build hash was updated.

##### [FS](Filesystem%20services.md "wikilink")

Only GNU build hash was updated.

##### [Loader](Loader%20services.md "wikilink")

  - ldr:pm-\>CreateProcess() now performs additional validation on the
    NPDM header.
      - When the title id is one of certain hardcoded titles, Loader now
        validates that the version field at NPDM header is non-zero.
        This prevents selectively downgrading those titles to versions
        vulnerable to known exploits.
      - The titles checked are:
          - settings
          - bus
          - audio
          - nvservices
          - ns
          - ssl
          - es
          - creport
          - ro

##### [NCM](NCM%20services.md "wikilink")

Only GNU build hash was updated.

##### [PM](Process%20Manager%20services.md "wikilink")

Only GNU build hash was updated.

##### [SM](Services%20API.md "wikilink")

SM was not updated.

##### [SPL](SPL%20services.md "wikilink")

SPL was not updated.
