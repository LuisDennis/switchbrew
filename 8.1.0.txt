*ldr:pm->CreateProcess() now performs additional validation on the NPDM header.
** When the title id is one of certain hardcoded titles, Loader now validates that the version field at NPDM header is non-zero. This prevents selectively downgrading those titles to versions vulnerable to known exploits.
** The titles checked are:
*** settings
*** bus
*** audio
*** nvservices
*** ns
*** ssl
*** es
*** creport
*** ro
