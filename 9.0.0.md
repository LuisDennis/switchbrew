<check back later for diff>

#### Secure Monitor

Secure Monitor was updated.

  - CPU Suspend SMC code now explicitly initializes the state of I2C5
    before communicating with the PMIC, instead of assuming that it is
    in a valid state.
  - Code for initializing MMIO inside package2ldr now writes random
    values to a number of PMC secure scratch registers, and validates
    that the written values are read back successfully before locking
    the scratch.
      - TODO: Check back later for information on what these scratch do.

#### KernelLdr

[KernelLdr](Kernel%20Loader.md "wikilink") was updated.

  - TPIDR\_EL1 is now set to 0, and VBAR\_EL1 is now set to a table that
    infinite loops on all exceptions other than synchronous from same
    exception level.
      - synch\_spx\_el1 now restores a number of registers from a
        context with pointer in TPIDR\_EL1.
  - TPIDR\_EL1 is now set to a context save struct before
    manufacturer-specific system registers are set, and validated to be
    non-0/NULL afterwards. It is then cleared.
      - Support was added for Cortex-A53 specific CPU initialization.
  - Kernel .rodata is now initially mapped as RW- instead of R--, and
    then reprotected to R-- after relocations are completed.
      - This allows for/implements .rel.ro.

The anti-downgrade code in CreateProcess was updated.

    up from an array in .rodata on a per-module basis.

        version.
