===FIRM===
All files in RomFS were updated.

====NX_BOOTLOADER====
NX bootloader was updated.

<check back later for diff>

====Secure Monitor====
Secure Monitor was updated.

* CPU Suspend SMC code now explicitly initializes the state of I2C5 before communicating with the PMIC, instead of assuming that it is in a valid state.
* Code for initializing MMIO inside package2ldr now writes random values to a number of PMC secure scratch registers, and validates that the written values are read back successfully before locking the scratch.
** TODO: Check back later for information on what these scratch do.

====KernelLdr====
[[Kernel Loader|KernelLdr]] was updated.

* TPIDR_EL1 is now set to 0, and VBAR_EL1 is now set to a table that infinite loops on all exceptions other than synchronous from same exception level.
** synch_spx_el1 now restores a number of registers from a context with pointer in TPIDR_EL1.
* TPIDR_EL1 is now set to a context save struct before manufacturer-specific system registers are set, and validated to be non-0/NULL afterwards. It is then cleared.
** Support was added for Cortex-A53 specific CPU initialization.
* Kernel .rodata is now initially mapped as RW- instead of R--, and then reprotected to R-- after relocations are completed.
** This allows for/implements .rel.ro.

====Kernel====
Kernel was updated.
