This sysmodule handles a lot of stuff internally, going by
service-access-control etc.

Contains multiple raw images, with at least the following:
"NN\_OMM\_CHARGING\_BIN\_{begin|end}"(charging icon), low-battery icon,
and the Nintendo Switch logo displayed during system boot.

This is only sysmodule using the
[usb:pd\*](USB%20services.md "wikilink") [Dock](Dock.md "wikilink")
services besides [PTM\_services](PTM%20services.md "wikilink").
