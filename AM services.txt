This sysmodule handles a lot of stuff internally, going by service-access-control etc.

Contains multiple raw images, with at least the following: "NN_OMM_CHARGING_BIN_{begin|end}"(charging icon), low-battery icon, and the Nintendo Switch logo displayed during system boot.

This is only sysmodule using the [[USB_services|usb:pd*]] [[Dock]] services besides [[PTM_services]].
