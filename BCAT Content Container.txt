The header is 0x120-bytes.

=Key generation=
The AES keydata is the output from pkcs5_pbkdf2_hmac, with SHA256: password = <passphrase string loaded from file>, salt = <below salt string>, and iteration_count=4096.

The passphrase is loaded from "<basepath>/passphrase.bin". passphrase_len=strlen(passphrase). 0x40-bytes are read from the file, with 0x0 being written to passphrase[total_read_data]. salt_len = strlen(salt).

salt is the snprintf output from "%016llx%s", where the former is presumably the titleID, while the latter is secretdata_str. secretdata_str = secretdata_array[<value of hdr+0x7>].

Settings config for 1-byte <"bcat", "production_mode"> is loaded, when retval!=1 or output_config!=0, then secretdata_array = secretdata_array0(retail), otherwise secretdata_array = secretdata_array1(devunit). The latter only contains empty strings, while the former contains lower-case hex strings. There are 16 entries in each array.
