The "Error upload" service reads and uploads error reports from <code>erpt:r</code> to a cloud server.

This includes crash dumps with full exception info created by [[creport]].

It periodically uploads them to the following URL:

https://receive-%.er.srv.nintendo.net/post

The functionality can be disabled from <code>set:sys</code> by setting ("eupld", "upload_enabled") to anything but 1.

This is "nn::eupld::sf::IControl".
