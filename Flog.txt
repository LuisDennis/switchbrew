This is the system "flog" 01008BB00013C000 [[Title_list|title]]. This is a NES emulator. Installed on retail systems since [[1.0.0]].

The titleID for "flog" is used by 3 funcs in [[qlaunch]]: 1 for checking whether to launch it, 1 for launching(?), and 1 that compares flog titleID with a field.

The ROM is not loaded via [[Filesystem_services|FS]] but is embedded in the main binary.

"flog" == "golf" backwards. This runs the NES "Golf" game. {1/2}-player via joy-con is supported. Controls are "d-pad" buttons + stick, however motion control while holding the Z{L/R} button is also supported instead of using buttons.

==Official Launch==
The checks for this only run while Home Menu is active, aka main-menu.

It checks exactly the following:
* Both Joy-Cons must be detached from the system.
* The same motion checks for both Joy-Cons must pass, at the same time.
* The date is checked.
* The output from a certain function must return 0..2. On one system this was tested with, this check would pass.
* Lastly a nsam cmd is used. Probably to verify that the title is installed?

Once everything passes it continues to the code which launches(?) flog.

==Screenshots==
These screenshots were originally taken by executing flog with an unofficial method.
