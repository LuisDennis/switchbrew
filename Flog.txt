This is the system "flog" 01008BB00013C000 [[Title_list|title]]. This is a NES emulator. Installed on retail systems since [[1.0.0]].

The titleID for "flog" is used by 3 funcs in [[qlaunch]]: 1 for checking whether to launch it, 1 for launching(?), and 1 that compares flog titleID with a field.

The ROM is not loaded via [[Filesystem_services|FS]] but is embedded in the main binary.

"flog" == "golf" backwards. This runs the NES "Golf" game. {1/2}-player via joy-con is supported. Controls are "d-pad" buttons + stick, however motion control while holding the Z{L/R} button is also supported instead of using buttons.

==Official Launch==
The checks for this only run while Home Menu is active, aka main-menu.

It checks exactly the following:
* Both Joy-Cons must be detached from the system.
* The same motion checks for both Joy-Cons must pass, at the same time. The motion seems to be a reference to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=17&v=BdQg43n2OaM this]. Hold the Joy-Cons pointing forwards/downwards, then move Joy-Cons to a vertical position, and hold it there for a bit. The Joy-Con grip can be used for this.
* The month+day must match the date of Iwata's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoru_Iwata death]: July 11. The loaded date originates from network-time-sync'd time, regardless of whether the user has it enabled or not. When the system was never connected to the Internet, it comes from the user-specified date instead. This is loaded from the [[PCV_services|time]] service-cmds, with the actual time-sync being handled by [[NIM_services|NIM]].
* The output from a certain function must return 0, 1, or 2. On one system this was tested with, this check would pass.
* Lastly a nsam cmd is used. Probably to verify that the title is installed?

Once everything passes it continues to the code which launches(?) flog.
