Known internally as "XCI" (NX Card Image), this is the format used for storing the contents of a Nintendo Switch Gamecard. 

= Gamecard Header =
This header is 0x200 bytes and is located at offset 0 in the Gamecard.

= Gamecard Certificate =
This is the Gamecard's unique certificate and is located at offset 0x7000.

The data between the Gamecard Certificate and the start of the HFS0 region is all 0xFF.

= Initial Data =
This data is used for challenge–response authentication when changing to the Gamecard's secure mode.

[[Filesystem_services|FS]] calculates a SHA-256 hash over the whole 0x200 bytes and compares it with the hash stored at offset 0x160 in the [[#Gamecard Header|Gamecard Header]].

= HFS0 =
This is the Gamecard file system which starts with magicnum "HFS0".

== Header ==
The "SHA-256 File System" or "HFS0" starts at offset 0xF000 in the Gamecard. The first 0x200 bytes act as a global header and represent the root partition which points to the other partitions ("normal", "logo", "update" and "secure).

A hash for this header is stored at offset 0x140 in the [[#Gamecard Header|Gamecard Header]].

== File System ==
The actual file system is as follows (also valid for the root partition):

| X
| File Entry Table
|-
| 0x10 + X
| Y
| String Table
|-
| 0x10 + X + Y
| Z
| Raw File Data
|}

Where File Entry Table consists of Number of Files FileEntries:

|-
| 0x0
| 0x8
| Offset of file in Data

| 0x4
| Offset of filename in String Table
|-
| 0x14
| 0x4
| Size of Hashed region of file (for HFS0s, this is the size of the pre-filedata portion, for NCAs this is usually 0x200)
|-
| 0x18
| 8
| Zero/Reserved
|-
| 0x20
| 0x20
| SHA-256 hash of the first (size of hashed region) bytes of filedata
|}

The string table is 00-padded to align the start of raw filedata with a sector/media unit boundary (usually?).

= Cartridge Layout =
Observed gamecards contain three partitions: "update", "normal", and "secure".

The update partition (Gamecard partition 0 for fsp-srv cmd 31) contains .cnmt.nca + .nca files for the entire system update required to play the game. Launch day carts contain a full copy of 1.0 ncas, newer carts contain newer sysupdate NCAs etc.

The normal partition contains the .cnmt.nca and the game icondata nca. This is presumably for future compatibility so that if a future update changes the cryptographic protocol for the secure partition, Game icon data can still be shown in the home menu on old firmwares.

The secure partition contains an identical copy of the .cnmt.nca and game icondata nca, as well as all other ncas required for the game.

The entire rest of the Gamecard after the secure partition ends is all FF padding.

[4.0.0+] The "normal" partition is now empty and a new partition "logo" was added.
