## Installing

Applications are installed by copying the necessary files directly to
the `switch/` folder in the root of the SD card, or in a subdirectory of
`switch/`, in which case said subfolder must be named identically to its
executable. Normally the former should be used, unless you want a
dedicated directory for the application FS current-working-directory.
Applications come with the following:

  - `[appname].nro`: The executable.

The Homebrew Launcher will scan the SD card for all `.nro` files, but
will only display an icon for those who have one according to the format
described above. You can also freely navigate the filesystem to select
an application.
