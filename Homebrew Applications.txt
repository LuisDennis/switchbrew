== Installing ==
Applications are installed by copying the necessary files directly to the <code>switch/</code> folder in the root of the SD card, or in a subdirectory of <code>switch/</code>, in which case said subfolder must be named identically to its executable. Normally the former should be used. The latter should be used if the application uses anything from FS current-working-directory (directory where the NRO is located). Applications come with the following:
* <code>[appname].nro</code>: The executable.

The Homebrew Menu will scan the SD card for all <code>.nro</code> files, but will only display an icon for those who have one according to the format described above. You can also freely navigate the filesystem to select an application.

Icon/metadata for each application is loaded from data embedded in the NRO (custom assets section), if available.

== Notes ==

 Distribution and promotion of tools to create or work with commercial game dumps is illegal under DMCA and EUCD provisions. Such tools risk legal repercussions and should not be linked or promoted here.
