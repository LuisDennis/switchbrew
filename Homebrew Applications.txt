== Installing ==
Applications are installed by copying the necessary files directly to the <code>switch/</code> folder in the root of the SD card, or in a subdirectory of <code>switch/</code>, in which case said subfolder must be named identically to its executable. Normally the former should be used. The latter should be used if the application uses anything from FS current-working-directory (directory where the NRO is located). Applications come with the following:
* <code>[appname].nro</code>: The executable.

The Homebrew Menu will scan the SD card for all <code>.nro</code> files, but will only display an icon for those who have one according to the format described above. You can also freely navigate the filesystem to select an application.

Icon/metadata for each application is loaded from data embedded in the NRO (custom assets section), if available.
