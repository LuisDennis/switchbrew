This is the Switch version of the 3DS hotspot.conf [https://3dbrew.org/wiki/Nintendo_Zone#Hotspot.conf_format file].

This 0100000000000807 title contains "/ssid_list.csv" in the FS.

The first line in the file is the decimal version. This is the same one accessible from Error History in System Settings.
The rest of the file is the actual info for each hotspot, with all config needed to connect to them, including network crypto if needed.
