## Why update to [3.0.0](3.0.0.md "wikilink")

First, if you are on [1.0.0](1.0.0.md "wikilink") stay on it, it will be
possible to install [Custom
Firmware](Custom%20Firmware.md "wikilink").  
Then, [3.0.0](3.0.0.md "wikilink") system version is the most vulnerable
for Homebrews and lower system version are not compatible with
[PegaSwitch](PegaSwitch.md "wikilink").
