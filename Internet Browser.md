<b>Internet Browser</b> is a web browser preloaded on the Nintendo
Switch. It is the [NetFront
NX](https://web.archive.org/web/20170304075230/https://gl.access-company.com/news_event/archives/2017/170303/)
browser, which is based on Webkit.  
The browser functionality is not accessible to the user, since there is
no app for it. However, it can be accessed via an
[exploit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5x9g68/browser_and_video_player_are_fully_functional/).
When linking the Nintendo Account with Facebook, the Facebook Auth
website will open, offering a search box that can be used to browse the
internet. Alternatively, it can be accessed with [custom DNS
settings](https://gbatemp.net/threads/web-browser-kind-of-on-the-switch.463094/)
which simulate a Wi-Fi login page.

Some old exploits like browserhax\_fright\_tx3g crash the browser but
are probably not
usable
