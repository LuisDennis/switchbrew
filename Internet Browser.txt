Nintendo Switch does not have a normal Internet Browser for user usage. However, there is multiple browser applets. It is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170304075230/https://gl.access-company.com/news_event/archives/2017/170303/ NetFront NX] browser, which is based on Webkit.

When linking the Nintendo Account with Facebook, the Facebook Auth website will open, offering a search box that can be used to browse the Internet ("LoginApplet"). Alternatively, it can be accessed with [https://gbatemp.net/threads/web-browser-kind-of-on-the-switch.463094/ custom DNS settings] which simulate a Wi-Fi login page ("WifiWebAuthApplet" for captive-portal).

When whitelisting is enabled, you can only load page domains included in the whitelist, otherwise an error is displayed. This only applies to page navigation. Videos via the <video> tag are not affected, likewise with network requests with JS.

== OSS ==
The NROs for the OSS are stored under a separate [[Title_list|title]]. All of the web-applets use the same OSS NROs via this title.

== Video Playback ==
WifiWebAuthApplet does not fully support playing videos. It will crash with normal videos. However, in some cases with certain MP4s using vulns it will display an error dialog instead.

== Trusted RootCAs ==
While the rootCA(s) for Let's Encrypt isn't included, Let's Encrypt is indirectly trusted via "Digital Signature Trust Co.". This seems to be only(?) the case for WifiWebAuthApplet, hence non-WifiWebAuthApplet seems to have a different set of trusted rootCAs.

== WifiWebAuthApplet ==
When doing a connection-test in system-settings, it will detect that the captive-portal is required and display an error for it when the response for "http://conntest.nintendowifi.net/" doesn't include the "X-Organization: Nintendo" HTTP header. The web-applet will not load until something else attempts a conntest, for example when launching eShop and prior to LoginApplet launching. The initial page loaded by this applet is the above conntest URL.

This is only available starting with [[2.0.0]].

== Versions ==

=== 2.1.0 ===
See [[Switch_Userland_Flaws|here]] for vuln-related changes.

The WebKit NRO was updated. For the WebKit NRO, the page-aligned size for the R-X, R--, and RW- pages are the same as v2.0.
