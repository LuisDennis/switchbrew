Nintendo Switch does not have a normal Internet Browser for user usage. However, there is multiple browser applets. It is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170304075230/https://gl.access-company.com/news_event/archives/2017/170303/ NetFront NX] browser, which is based on Webkit.

When linking the Nintendo Account with Facebook, the Facebook Auth website will open, offering a search box that can be used to browse the Internet ("LoginApplet"). Alternatively, it can be accessed with [https://gbatemp.net/threads/web-browser-kind-of-on-the-switch.463094/ custom DNS settings] which simulate a Wi-Fi login page ("WifiWebAuthApplet" for captive-portal).

When whitelisting is enabled, you can only load page domains included in the whitelist, otherwise an error is displayed. This only applies to page navigation. Videos via the <video> tag are not affected, likewise with network requests with JS.

== OSS ==
The NROs for the OSS are stored under a separate [[Title_list|title]]. All of the web-applets use the same OSS NROs via this title.

String from v2.0 in oss_wkc.nro: "libcurl/7.50.1".

== Video Playback ==
WifiWebAuthApplet does not fully support playing videos. It will crash with normal videos. However, in some cases with certain MP4s using vulns it will display an error dialog instead.

== Trusted RootCAs ==
While the rootCA(s) for Let's Encrypt isn't included, Let's Encrypt is indirectly trusted via "Digital Signature Trust Co.". This seems to be only(?) the case for WifiWebAuthApplet, hence non-WifiWebAuthApplet seems to have a different set of trusted rootCAs.

== WifiWebAuthApplet ==
When doing a connection-test in system-settings, it will detect that the captive-portal is required and display an error for it when the response for "http://conntest.nintendowifi.net/" doesn't include the "X-Organization: Nintendo" HTTP header. The web-applet will not load until something else attempts a conntest, for example when launching eShop and prior to LoginApplet launching. The initial page loaded by this applet is the above conntest URL.

This is only available starting with [[2.0.0]].

=== [[2.1.0]] ===
See [[Switch_Userland_Flaws|here]] for vuln-related changes.

The WebKit NRO was updated. For the WebKit NRO, the page-aligned size for the R-X, R--, and RW- pages are the same as v2.0.
* The actual code in the NRO starts differing starting at offset 0xE780. In v2.0 the offset following the last code instruction is text_lastpage+0x3F8(text_end-0xC08), while for v2.1 it's text_lastpage+0xE60(text_end-0x1A0). Compared to the previous version, there's a val0 u32(padding) inserted where the code for the import stubs begin, near the end of .text. Relative to that end offset going backwards, .text differs starting at v2.0 textbase+0xD56530 / v2.1 textbase+0xD56F94.
* The R-- section was updated. Besides the large table(?) which was updated(nothing was added/removed there), the strings containing "D:/for_cruiser/release_182/nx/webkit/" were updated: "182" was changed to "189". 0x10-bytes at offset 0x57292C were removed. 0x8-bytes were inserted at offset 0x14B2B5C in the v2.1 section. 0x8-bytes were inserted at offset 0x14B5C10 in the v2.1 section. ...
* The RW- section was updated, mainly for different addrs. Nothing was added/removed. Most(?)/all(?) main-codebin func import-addrs relative to main-codebin-base are the same as v2.0.

Main-codebin region(titleID 010000000000100B):
* rtld is same as before basically, minus addrs. Likewise for the "nnSdkEmpty" binary following the main-codebin.
* Various byte values were changed in the main .text.
* In the main R-- section:
** The length of a string used with the user-agent changed, due to being changed from "{...}.9" to "{...}.10".
** The version in the following string was changed from "1.2.2" to "1.2.3": "FS_ACCESS: { sdk_versio n: 1.2.3, spec:  NX }"
** The datetime strings following "b/23876444" was changed from "Feb 10 2017" "02:24:47" to "Mar  9 201 7" "21:41:27".
** A 0x10-byte block prior to SDK library tag strings was updated. The version in those strings was changed from "1_2_2" to "1_2_3".
* The main RW- section appears to be basically the same minus addrs.

wkc_peer.nro from memory:
* The R-X section is identical to the previous version except for the 0x10-byte block in the NRO header. 
* The R-- section only had version values in "/release_{ver}/" strings updated, see the for_cruiser path mentioned for WebKit NRO above. The only other change was that a 0x10-byte block was updated.
* The first 0x46000-bytes in the RW- section are the same as before besides addrs. This is the region prior to the memory-mirror block in this section, which has permissions=none.

==== FS ====
The content of "blacklist:/" and "oceanShared:/" haven't changed.

===== "shareddata:/" =====
The following files were updated here(nothing added/removed):

* /buildinfo/buildinfo.dat
* /dll/cairo_wkc.nro
* /dll/libfont.nro
* /dll/oss_wkc.nro
