Manu ("Manufacturing") services are provided by the 010000000000B14A sysmodule, which is installed at the [[Factory_Setup|factory]] but not on normal retail systems.

All commands are wrappers for [[USB_services|usb:ds]] requests with USB configured as:
 VID: 0x057E (Nintendo Co., Ltd)
 PID: 0x3000
 BCD: [0x62-byte array]
     0x00: 0x0100
     0x02: "Nintendo"
     0x22: "NintendoSdkDebugger"
     0x42: "SerialNumber"

[[SystemInitializer]] only uses cmd1..cmd3.

== InitUsbTransferPipeFsFile ==
Takes an unknown u32 (ID?) and configures a transfer pipe over [[USB_services|usb:ds]] for file access mode.

== FsFile_Exists ==
Takes an input path string (type-0x9 buffer), returns 8-bytes for the output u8 flag.

Checks whether the specified file exists.

This is "FsFile::Exists" in SystemInitializer.

== FsFile_Read ==
Takes a type-0x6 output buffer and a type-0x9 input string path buffer, and 3 u64s: <same size value from databuf>, unk, <same size value from databuf>. Where unk is probably offset?

Reads data from the specified file.

== FsFile_Write ==
Same as FsFile_Read except the databuf is a type-0x5 input buffer.

Writes data to the specified file.

SystemInitializer also uses this as "FsFile::Create" with all input u64s set to 0.

== InitUsbTransferPipeRaw ==
Takes an unknown u32 (ID?) and configures a transfer pipe over [[USB_services|usb:ds]] for raw access mode.

== Raw_Read ==
Takes a type-0x6 output buffer and 2 u64s: '''offset''' and '''size'''.

Reads raw data from the device.

== Raw_Write ==
Takes a type-0x5 input buffer and 2 u64s: '''offset''' and '''size'''.

Writes raw data to the device.
