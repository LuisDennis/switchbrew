This page is for the FS which can be mounted for [[NCA|NCAs]] with [[Filesystem_services|MountContent*]]. FS-type below is the in32 for "MountContent". MountContent throws errors when trying to access a NCA-type with a FS-type not listed below.

=NCA-type0=
==FS-type5==

Only contains the [[NCA|.cnmt]] file.

=NCA-type1=
==FS-type2==
Contains the logo gfx displayed when an application is booted. Doesn't include the "Licensed" gfx.

* "/NintendoLogo.png" Nintendo logo displayed in the top-left of the screen.
* "/StartupMovie.gif" Nintendo Switch animation displayed in the bottom-right of the screen.

=NCA-type2=
Unknown. Presumably what the nandsys 8XX titles use.

=NCA-type3=
==FS-type3==
* "/control.nacp". Roughly equivalent to non-gfx areas of 3DS SMDH. Also includes a string for the display-version of this title. Contains UTF-8 title name/etc strings, unlike SMDH which uses UTF-16.
* "/icon_{Language}.dat", for every icon with an included language. Just a 256x256 JPEG, no MAC which [[Album]] screenshots use. EXIF info: "Camera Brand" = "Nintendo co., ltd", "Software" = "Nintendo AuthoringTool".
