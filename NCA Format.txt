Raw NCAs are encrypted.

The only known section which is not encrypted in the raw NCA is the logo section, when the NCA includes that section.

==Logo section==
Contains the raw FS for the logo FS, see [[NCA_Content_FS|here]] for mounted-FS contents.

There's 0x4000-bytes of zeros at rawnca+0x4000, then the actual data starts at absolute offset 0x8000, which is the PFS0.

=PFS0=
This is the FS which has magicnum "PFS0" at header+0.
