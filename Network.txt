This page documents the DNS domains used by Switch, and what they're used for. Only HTTPS is used with these domains unless noted otherwise.

* "sun.hac.lp1.d4c.nintendo.net": Used for checking whether a sysupdate is available, equivalent to NetUpdateSOAP from past systems.
* "atumn.hac.lp1.d4c.nintendo.net": CDN for system-titles.
* "tagaya.hac.lp1.eshop.nintendo.net": VersionList for eShop titles going by 3DS.
* "dauth-lp1.ndas.srv.nintendo.net": Seems to break Nintendo-account related comms when blocked. This dauth domain seems to be the cause of the sysupdate-required 2124-3000 [[Error_codes|error]]?
* "beach.hac.lp1.eshop.nintendo.net": Same result as dauth when blocked.
* "consumer.lp1.npns.srv.nintendo.net": Same result as dauth when blocked.

Note: "break Nintendo-acount..." is for "posting to social-media" in user-profile, results may vary with eShop(for non-dauth).
