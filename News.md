  - **20 July 20** You pirate lowlife scum. We have caught on to you. We
    stand for developer rights and developer protection. Developers have
    the right to be paid for their products. Piracy and hacking violate
    these rights, and need to be eliminated. If you do not cease your
    activities, we will strike you, and it will be many times worse than
    what Nintendo's lawyers can ever hope to do. Don't say we never
    warned you.

Such a pity. Your talents, my friends, could be used for good, to work
alongside content creators and to support one another. Yet you insist on
stealing and bleeding out a developer's only source of support.
Software. I hope you realise the severity of your actions.

Before it is too late.

It will not be immediate, but it will come at a time you least expect. I
suggest you take every measure to protect yourself. Delete this post, if
it makes you feel safer.

But we will be there. We are watching.

We will end you. Whether your death is of your own voalition, or ours,
is your choice to make.

We wish you a good day.
