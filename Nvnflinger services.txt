Nvnflinger is responsible for mediating the communication between [[Display_services|vi]] and [[NV_services|nvservices]].
The [[Display_services|vi]] sysmodule relays display accesses to nvnflinger which in turn uses [[NV_services#.2Fdev.2Fnvdisp-ctrl|/dev/nvdisp-ctrl]] and [[NV_services#.2Fdev.2Fnvdisp-disp0.2C_.2Fdev.2Fnvdisp-disp1|/dev/nvdisp-disp0, /dev/nvdisp-disp1]] from [[NV_services|nvservices]].
