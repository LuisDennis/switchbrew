This page is for the Switch equivalent of online/local protocol [https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/PRUDP PRUDP].

Note: the wifi protocol used for local-WLAN is different from UDS, which 3DS and Wii U used.

The Switch still uses UDP with a different/updated protocol for peer to peer communication (packets starting with 0x32AB9864). For Nintendo server comms, a bunch of https requests are made instead of using PRUDP.
