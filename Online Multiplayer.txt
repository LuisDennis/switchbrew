This page is for the Switch equivalent of online/local protocol [https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/PRUDP PRUDP].

Note: the wifi protocol used for local-WLAN is different from UDS, which 3DS and Wii U used.

This protocol has changed since PRUDP. The actual data in the UDP frames start with hex "32 ab 98 64".
