This is the applet presented when launching a game that allows the user to select a user.

See [[AM_services#Library_Applets]]. The profile selector expects a two [[AM_services#IStorage|IStorage]] inputs and a single [[AM_services#IStorage|IStorage]] output.

== UserSelectionConfig ==

This has size 0xA0 and seems to only affect the UI display. Typical value is all zero with byte 0x96 equal to 0x01.

== Result == 
This is 0x18-bytes.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"

! Offset || Size || Notes
|-
| 0x0 || 0x8 || Result (0 = Success, 2 = Failure)
|-
| 0x8 || 0x10 || UUID of selected user
|-
|}

== Usage == 
User-processes should push a common arguments struct and the typical UserSelectionConfig struct as well. After pushing in the data and calling start, user-processes should wait upon the PopOutDataEvent and then pop a single IStorage to obtain the result structure described above.
