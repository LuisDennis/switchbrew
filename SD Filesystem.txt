== Album ==
Contains the screenshots: "YYYY/MM/DD/<hex>.jpg". These contain some sort of MAC, the system will display an error for screenshots with invalid MACs.

== save ==
Contains system-only savedata "8000000000000000" and "8000000000000124".

== Contents ==
Contains directories "placehld" and "registered".

Also contains file "private". Modifying this file results in the system throwing the <this microSD is for another system> error.

"placehld" and "registered" are the same, except that the former stores the temp data during eShop title download, while the latter is for the final title data. The contents of the former for a title("placehld/<hex>/") are moved into the latter when title download finishes. When a title is launched(?), the already empty "placehld/<hex>" directories are deleted.

No titleIDs are stored in any directories/filenames here.
