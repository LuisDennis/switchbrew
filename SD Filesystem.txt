All files stored under the Contents sub-directories and save/ use the [[NAX0]] format.

== Album ==
Contains the screenshots: "YYYY/MM/DD/<hex>.jpg". These contain some sort of MAC, the system will display an error for screenshots with invalid MACs.

== save ==
Contains system-only savedata "8000000000000000" and "8000000000000124".

== Contents ==
It seems this directory didn't exist until [[2.0.0]].

Contains directories "placehld" and "registered".

Also contains file "private", which stores the 0x10 [[Filesystem_services|#SetSdCardEncryptionSeed|sd card seed verification vector]]. 

===placehld and registered ===
"placehld" and "registered" store game contents; contents are initially downloaded temporarily into the "placehld" folder, and then [[NCM_services#IContentStorage|moved into the registered folder]] when downloading is complete. 

Some of the "placehld/<hex>" directories are temp-only and don't get moved into "registered".

No titleIDs are stored in any directories/filenames here.

All hex IDs(below 000000XX and NcaId) used here are unique per title/content. XX is calculated as the first byte from the output of SHA-256(NcaId).

Game contents are stored inside [[NAX0]] archives; due to the 4 GB filesize limit on FAT32, contents that are bigger than 4 GB have additional file contents automatically split into separate files. This automatic file-splitting occurs even on exFAT SD cards where it is not necessary.
