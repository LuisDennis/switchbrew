SSL-sysmodule uses [[Settings_services|set:cal]] [[Settings_services#GetSslKey|GetSslKey]] and [[Settings_services#GetSslCert|GetSslCert]]. The rest of this section documents handling for the former, which can be decrypted with [[SPL_services|SPL]].

key* below refers to the 3 0x10-byte input blocks passed to this code.

When actual_size is:
* 0x100+0x10: If the u32 actual_size is less than (u32)-0x11, and the last 0x10-bytes of the actual-data are all-zero, the data is copied to the output as raw plaintext. If a non-zero byte is found, it will continue with [[SPL_services|SPL]] usage, skipping over the SPL block for the devunit flag. In this case, key=key0 and the flag passed to SPL later is set to 0.
* 0x100+0x30: Size must match this if it's not the above, otherwise error 0xC81A is returned. The flag passed to SPL later is set to 1 in this case. Runs the devunit-flag-block: uses [[SPL_services#SPL#GetDevunitFlag]]. key = key1 when out_flag!=0, key2 otherwise.
