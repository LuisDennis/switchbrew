Just like the 3DS/N3DS, the Switch exposes an API which communicates with certain services. Services are system processes running in the background which wait for incoming requests. When a process wants to communicate with a service, it first needs to get a handle to the named service, and then it can communicate with the service via inter-process communication (each service has a name up to 8 characters).

Handles for services are retrieved from the service manager port, "sm:". Services are an abstraction of ports, they operate the same way except regular ports can have their handles retrieved directly from a SVC.
