# Setup

  - Install [devkitA64](http://devkitpro.org/). If it's already
    installed, update it.
      - On Windows, there's a [graphical
        installer](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases).
      - On Unix-like platforms such as Linux/macOS, there's a [Perl
        script](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/blob/master/perl/devkitA64update.pl).
      - Make sure you also select libnx and the switch examples when
        installing.
