= Setup =
Install [http://devkitpro.org/ devkitA64]. If it's already installed, update it. On Windows, there's a [https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases/latest graphical installer]. On Unix-like platforms such as Linux/macOS, there's a [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devkitPro/installer/master/perl/devkitA64update.pl Perl script]. Make sure you also select libnx and the switch examples when installing.

==Windows==
devkitPro provides 64bit precompiled windows binaries of devkitA64 which can be run directly on Windows.
* [https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases download the latest version of the graphical installer] from github and run it, following the instructions as you go.
* An Internet connection is required.
* You will want to make sure devkitA64 is selected during the installation process to develop for the Switch - you can also install  devkitARM (for 3DS, DS and GBA) and devkitPPC (for GameCube/Wii development) if you wish.
* Once the installer has finished, launch MSYS from:
** Windows 7 and earlier: Start -> All Programs -> devkitPro -> MSYS
** Windows 8 and 8.1: Right click on the Start screen and select 'All Apps'. You should find MSYS there.
** Windows 10 (pre-Anniversary Update): Start -> All Apps -> devkitPro -> MSYS
** Windows 10 (post-Anniversary Update): Start -> devkitPro -> MSYS

==Unix-like platforms==
Currently devkitPro provides precompiled versions of devkitA64 for the following Unix-like platforms: Linux (x86_64), macOS (x86_64). Note that Linux x86_64 binaries are usable under WSL.

* Follow the instructions to install pacman found at https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman/releases/latest
* run sudo (dkp-)pacman -S switch-dev to install the tools and libraries for switch development
* logout and login again to get the environment settings needed.

= Building the examples =
Switch examples are still being created; however, there are a growing number of examples available from the [https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples switchbrew/switch-examples GitHub repository]. These are downloaded by the installer and can be found in $DEVKITPRO/examples/switch

These can be built from the command line.

To start a new homebrew project from the <code>bash</code> shell, simply type the following (replacing <code>'''~/projects/myswitchproject'''</code> with the place you would like your project to be stored, with <code>~</code> meaning your HOME directory):
 cp -r $DEVKITPRO/examples/switch/templates/application '''~/projects/myswitchproject'''
 cd '''~/projects/myswitchproject'''

The standard Makefile will use the folder as the name of the .nro that will be built. You can keep that behaviour or simply change the <code>TARGET := $(notdir $(CURDIR))</code> line in the Makefile to explicitly name your project.

To compile it, type <code>make</code> in the project directory.
