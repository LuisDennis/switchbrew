Used for accessing data calibrated at the factory. Probably only for console-unique data?(Everything read so far has been console-unique)

== GetDeviceCert ==
Takes a type-0x16 output buffer with fixed size 0x180.

Returns the DeviceCert. This is identical to 3DS DeviceCert/CTCert besides the strings. NIM loads the DeviceId from this.

== GetDeviceCert2 ==
Takes a type-0x16 output buffer with fixed size 0x240.

Same as GetDeviceCert, except this returns more data and the data starts differing at offset 0x108 compared to GetDeviceCert.

== GetTLSClientPrivk ==
Takes a type-0x16 output buffer with fixed size 0x134.

Returns a container-structure for the encrypted TLS client-privk. Decrypting this fails unless an unknown size >0x134 is passed to this setcal cmd?

Used by SSL-sysmodule, see [[SSL_services|here]].

== GetTLSClientCert ==
Takes a type-0x16 output buffer with fixed size 0x804.

Returns a container-structure for the plaintext TLS client-cert.

Used by SSL-sysmodule, see [[SSL_services|here]].

Official user-processes get a new service session handle each time a set:sys cmd is used, with the session being closed aftewards.

== ReadSetting ==
Takes two type-0x19 input buffers and a type-0x6 output buffer. Returns an output u64 for the actual size written to the outbuf.

The outbuf_size is compared with the config_size. When config_size is larger than outbuf_size, outbuf_size is used for the memcpy, otherwise config_size is used. Afterwards the size used for the memcpy is written to output(see above).

== GetSystemVersion ==
Takes a type-0x1A output buffer. User-processes use hard-coded size 0x100.

If needed, reads the content of the [[System_Version_Title]] "/file" into state. This is only done once.

Then the above 0x100-byte data is copied to the output buffer.

== GetSerialNumber ==
Returns the 0x18-byte SerialNumber string.
