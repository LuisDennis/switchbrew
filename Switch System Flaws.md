# System flaws

## Hardware

Flaws in this category pertain to the underlying hardware that powers
the Switch.

This includes components shared across Tegra based devices such as the
[TSEC](TSEC.md "wikilink"), the [Security
Engine](Security%20Engine.md "wikilink"), the [GPU](GPU.md "wikilink")
and so on.

<td><p>The USB software stack provided inside the boot instruction rom (IROM/bootROM) contains a copy operation whose length can be controlled by an attacker. By carefully constructing a USB control request, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to copy the contents of an attacker-controlled buffer over the active execution stack, gaining control of the Boot and Power Management processor (BPMP) before any lock-outs or privilege reductions occur. This execution can then be used to exfiltrate secrets and to load arbitrary code onto the main CPU Complex (CCPLEX) &quot;application processors&quot; at the highest possible level of privilege (typically as the TrustZone Secure Monitor at PL3/EL3).</p></td>

<td><p>Weak Security Engine context validation</p></td>
<td><p>The Tegra X1 supports a &quot;deep sleep&quot; feature, where everything but DRAM and the PMC registers lose their content (and the SoC loses power). Upon awaking, the bootrom re-executes, restoring system state. Among these stored states is the Security Engine's saved state, which uses AES-128-CBC with a random key and all-zeroes IV. However, the bootrom doesn't perform a MAC on this data, and only validates the last block. This allows one to control most of security engine's state upon wakeup, if one has a way to modify the encrypted state buffer.</p>
<p>With a way to modify the encrypted state buffer, one can thus dump keys from &quot;write-only&quot; keyslots, etc.</p>
<p>This also bypasses the SBK protection of the bootROM: indeed, at warmboot, bootROM will always clear keyslot 0xE to prevent malicious code from saving the SBK. Moving the SBK to another keyslot in the saved context renders this protection moot.</p></td>

### Bootloader

Flaws in this category pertain to any bootloader component such as the
[package1ldr](Package1#Package1ldr.md##Package1ldr "wikilink"), the [NX
bootloader](Package1#Section%201.md##Section_1 "wikilink") or the
[warmboot binary](Package1#Section%200.md##Section_0 "wikilink").

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Null-dereference in panic()</p></td>
<td><p>The Switch's stage 1 bootloader, on panic(), clears the stack and then attempts to clear the Security Engine. However, it does so by dereferencing a pointer to the SE in .bss (initially NULL), and this pointer doesn't get initialized until partway into the bootloader's main() after several functions that might panic() are called. Thus, a panic() caused prior to SE initialization would result in the SE pointer still being NULL when dereferenced. The BPMP doesn't have an active MPU and the bus won't data abort on an invalid address, so no exception will be entered: it'll end up overwriting some exception vectors with NULL before halting.</p>
<p>In 3.0.0, this was fixed by moving the security engine initialization earlier in main(), before the first function that could potentially panic().</p></td>
<td><p>Some exception vectors overwritten with NULL, before SBK/other keyslots are cleared. Probably useless for anything more interesting.</p></td>

<td><p>FUSE_DIS_PGM not written by package1</p></td>
<td><p>The switch's hardware fuse driver contains a write-once bit in a register called &quot;FUSE_DIS_PGM&quot;, which disables burning fuses until the next reboot. While Nintendo's bootloader code for waking up from sleep writes this on all firmware, the actual package1 initial bootloader forgets to write to it on cold reboot.</p>
<p>This isn't too big of a problem because another fuse is burnt on retail devices (production mode), which prevents burning *all* fuses other than ODM_RESERVED ones in hardware.</p>
<p>This was fixed in 3.0.0 by writing to the register on cold boot (although the write happens in TZ instead of package1 where it should take place, possibly to obfuscate the fact that they made this mistake).</p></td>

<td><p>TSEC firmware compromises itself</p></td>
<td><p>Package1ldr loads a firmware blob into TSEC early on boot. This piece of code runs on the TSEC in Authenticated Mode and has the sole purpose of generating the per-console TSEC key (see <a href="Cryptosystem.md" title="wikilink">Cryptosystem</a>).</p>
<p>As a way to mitigate attacks, the TSEC firmware blob is split into 3 stages: <a href="TSEC#Stage 0.md##Stage_0" title="wikilink">Stage 0</a> which is unencrypted and unsigned, <a href="TSEC#Stage 1.md##Stage_1" title="wikilink">Stage 1</a> which is unencrypted but signed and <a href="TSEC#Stage 2.md##Stage_2" title="wikilink">Stage 2</a> which is encrypted and signed. Stage 0 loads a static pre-generated signature into the Falcon's CPU crypto registers, loads Stage 1 into the Falcon's CODE region and jumps to it. Execution will proceed into Stage 1 in Authenticated Mode if, and only if, the loaded signature matches the one Falcon calculates internally for Stage 1.</p>
<p>Among various things, Stage 1 will attempt to do a &quot;backwards&quot; security check by calculating a CMAC over Stage 0 and comparing it with a known hash stored in the TSEC firmware's key data (a small buffer stored after Stage 0's code). If the hashes don't match, execution aborts.</p>
<p>Stage 1 stores the calculated Stage 0's CMAC in the stack, but forgets to clear it. Since the stack is located in Falcon's DATA region, loading the TSEC firmware blob and dumping the DATA region afterwards (via MMIO) will reveal the calculated hash. This allows using Stage 1 as an oracle to generate a valid CMAC for arbitrary Stage 0 code. Replacing the CMAC in the TSEC firmware's key data region results in Stage 1 accepting any Stage 0 code, thus rendering this security measure useless.</p>
<p>Additionally, since signed Falcon code can't be revoked without an hardware revision, an attacker can always reuse the flawed Stage 1 code even if a fix is issued.</p></td>

On 1.0.0, this global variable was written using non-atomic writes, and thus a race condition is possible.</p>
<p>However, the SMC handler enforces that all SMCs must be called from core #3, unless the top-level handler ID is 1 (SMCs internal to the kernel). Thus, the only SMCs that can be run side-by-side are [any userland smc] and smcGetRandomBytesForKernel, and this turns out to not really be abusable.</p></td>

In addition, <a href="AM services.md" title="wikilink">am</a> ran a little-kernel based firmware on the BPMP at runtime. With code execution under am, one could modify the BPMP's little-kernel firmware to hook deep sleep entry, and modify TrustZone/Security engine state.</p>

When it does so, it is held in RESET, and TrustZone attempts to write to the BPMP exception vectors at 0x6000F200 to register EVP_RESET = lp0_entry_fw_crt0, and all other EVPs to a function that simply reboots. However, while they successfully write EVP_RESET, they miss all the other vectors, accidentally writing to the 0x6000F004-0x6000F020 region instead of the 0x6000F204-0x6000F220 region they want to write to. This results in all the exception vectors for the BPMP other than RESET being &quot;undefined&quot; (attacker controlled).</p>
<p>With some way of causing an exception vector to be taken at the right time, this would give pre-sleep code execution (and thus arbitrary TrustZone code execution, via the security engine flaw). However, none of the abort vectors are really triggerable, and interrupts are disabled for the BPMP when it is taken out of reset. Thus, this is useless in practice.</p>

<td><p>fsp-ldr command 0 &quot;MountCode&quot; takes in a Content Path (retrieved from NCM by Loader), and returns an IFileSystem for the resulting ExeFS. These content paths, are normally NCAs, but MountCode also supports a number of other formats, including &quot;.nsp&quot; -- which is just a PFS0.</p>
<p>When a path ending in &quot;.nsp&quot; is parsed by MountCode, the PFS0 is treated as a raw ExeFS. Because there is no NCA header, the ACID signatures are not validated -- and because there are no other signatures in a PFS0, this results in no signature checking happening at all.</p>
<p>The actual .nsp handling is eventually done by {content mounting function} called by MountCode and other FS commands.</p>
<p>Thus, by placing an ExeFS (NSOs + &quot;main.npdm&quot;) and setting one's desired title ID to &quot;@Sdcard:/some_title.nsp&quot; or &quot;@User:/some_title.nsp&quot; etc one can launch arbitrary unsigned code, with arbitrary unsigned NPDMs.</p>
<p>This appears to have been fixed by only allowing .nsp when the input fstype==7 for the internal content-mounting function, returning 0x2EE202 otherwise.</p></td>

<td><p>Previously, loader content path parsing looked like this, where path_from_lr was up to 0x300 bytes and not necessarily null-terminated:</p>
<p><code> char nca_path[0x300] = {0};</code><br />
<code> strcat(nca_path, path_from_lr);</code><br />
