| CVE-2018-6242 (leveraged by the ShofEL2 and Fusée Gelée exploits)
| The USB software stack provided inside the boot instruction rom (IROM/bootROM) contains a copy operation whose length can be controlled by an attacker. By carefully constructing a USB control request, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to copy the contents of an attacker-controlled buffer over the active execution stack, gaining control of the Boot and Power Management processor (BPMP) before any lock-outs or privilege reductions occur. This execution can then be used to exfiltrate secrets and to load arbitrary code onto the main CPU Complex (CCPLEX) "application processors" at the highest possible level of privilege (typically as the TrustZone Secure Monitor at PL3/EL3).

| GMMU DMA attack
| The Switch's GPU includes a separate MMU (GMMU) that is allowed to bypass the system's IOMMU (SMMU). By accessing the GPU's MMIO region and manipulating the page table entries in the GMMU, an attacker can read/write any portion of the DRAM (except memory carveouts).

[5.0.0+] Works around this hardware flaw by using memory pool partitioning. You can no longer escalate into sysmodules with GPU DMA because all their memory is allocated using heap that's carved out.

| Weak Security Engine context validation
| The Tegra X1 supports a "deep sleep" feature, where everything but DRAM and the PMC registers lose their content (and the SoC loses power). Upon awaking, the bootrom re-executes, restoring system state. Among these stored states is the Security Engine's saved state, which uses AES-128-CBC with a random key and all-zeroes IV. However, the bootrom doesn't perform a MAC on this data, and only validates the last block. This allows one to control most of security engine's state upon wakeup, if one has a way to modify the encrypted state buffer.

With a way to modify the encrypted state buffer, one can thus dump keys from "write-only" keyslots, etc.

This also bypasses the SBK protection of the bootROM: indeed, at warmboot, bootROM will always clear keyslot 0xE to prevent malicious code from saving the SBK. Moving the SBK to another keyslot in the saved context renders this protection moot.

| Security Engine keyslots vulnerable to partial overwrite attack
| 
The Tegra X1 security engine supports writing keyslot data to the engine with syntax as follows: 

SECURITY_ENGINE->AES_KEYTABLE_ADDR = (keyslot << 4) | (dword_index_in_keyslot); 

SECURITY_ENGINE->AES_KEYTABLE_DATA = readle32(key, dword_index_in_keyslot * 4); 

However, the Security Engine flushes writes to the internal key tables immediately when AES_KEYTABLE_DATA is written -- this allows one to overwrite a single dword of a key at a time, and thus brute force the contents of keyslots in time (2^32 * 8) = 2^35 instead of 2^256.

| Poor validation of bootrom SDRAM configuration parameters leads to arbitrary writes in bootrom
| 
The Tegra X1 bootrom supports saving SDRAM parameters to scratch registers, and using the saved configuration to enable DRAM during warmboot.

The code that parses these parameters does if (params->EmcBctSpareN) *params->EmcBctSpareN = params->EmcBctSpareNPlusOne for most N, without validating either the address or value written to it.
There are other arbitrary writes in this code, as well (e.g. BootromPatch parameters intended for patching MISC registers do not check a relative offset to 0x7000000, etc).

This allows a user with access to the PMC registers (via pre-sleep bpmp execution, or otherwise) to gain arbitrary bootrom code execution.

|  Null-dereference in panic()
|  The Switch's stage 1 bootloader, on panic(), clears the stack and then attempts to clear the Security Engine. However, it does so by dereferencing a pointer to the SE in .bss (initially NULL), and this pointer doesn't get initialized until partway into the bootloader's main() after several functions that might panic() are called. Thus, a panic() caused prior to SE initialization would result in the SE pointer still being NULL when dereferenced. 
The BPMP doesn't have an active MPU and the bus won't data abort on an invalid address, so no exception will be entered: it'll end up overwriting some exception vectors with NULL before halting.

In 3.0.0, this was fixed by moving the security engine initialization earlier in main(), before the first function that could potentially panic().
|  Some exception vectors overwritten with NULL, before SBK/other keyslots are cleared. Probably useless for anything more interesting.

|  FUSE_DIS_PGM not written by package1 
|  The switch's hardware fuse driver contains a write-once bit in a register called "FUSE_DIS_PGM", which disables burning fuses until the next reboot. While Nintendo's bootloader code for waking up from sleep writes this on all firmware, the actual package1 initial bootloader forgets to write to it on cold reboot. 

This isn't too big of a problem because another fuse is burnt on retail devices (production mode), which prevents burning *all* fuses other than ODM_RESERVED ones in hardware.

This was fixed in 3.0.0 by writing to the register on cold boot (although the write happens in TZ instead of package1 where it should take place, possibly to obfuscate the fact that they made this mistake).
|  Burning arbitrary ODM reserved fuses with TZ code execution, which should never be possible for non-bootloader code.

|  TSEC firmware compromises itself
|  Package1ldr loads a firmware blob into TSEC early on boot. This piece of code runs on the TSEC in Authenticated Mode and has the sole purpose of generating the per-console TSEC key (see [[Cryptosystem]]).

As a way to mitigate attacks, the TSEC firmware blob is split into 3 stages: [[TSEC#Stage_0|Stage 0]] which is unencrypted and unsigned, [[TSEC#Stage_1|Stage 1]] which is unencrypted but signed and [[TSEC#Stage_2|Stage 2]] which is encrypted and signed.
Stage 0 loads a static pre-generated signature into the Falcon's CPU crypto registers, loads Stage 1 into the Falcon's CODE region and jumps to it. Execution will proceed into Stage 1 in Authenticated Mode if, and only if, the loaded signature matches the one Falcon calculates internally for Stage 1.

Among various things, Stage 1 will attempt to do a "backwards" security check by calculating a CMAC over Stage 0 and comparing it with a known hash stored in the TSEC firmware's key data (a small buffer stored after Stage 0's code). If the hashes don't match, execution aborts.

Stage 1 stores the calculated Stage 0's CMAC in the stack, but forgets to clear it. Since the stack is located in Falcon's DATA region, loading the TSEC firmware blob and dumping the DATA region afterwards (via MMIO) will reveal the calculated hash.
This allows using Stage 1 as an oracle to generate a valid CMAC for arbitrary Stage 0 code. Replacing the CMAC in the TSEC firmware's key data region results in Stage 1 accepting any Stage 0 code, thus rendering this security measure useless.

Additionally, since signed Falcon code can't be revoked without an hardware revision, an attacker can always reuse the flawed Stage 1 code even if a fix is issued.
|  Running TSEC firmware's Stage 1 in a user controlled environment. Mostly useless, but may aid in side-channel attacks.

|  pk1ldrhax
|  Package1ldr decrypts and verifies the keyblob inside of the current BCT in order to get the package1 key, and then uses the package1 key to decrypt package1. It then validates package1 before jumping to it by checking the PK11 magic number, and that the section sizes sum to the expected size (and are individually less than the expected size). 

However, package1ldr does not actually validate the package1 key against a fixed vector (much like kernel9loader forgot to do so on the 3ds). This would normally not matter, as keyblobs are validated -- however, with bootrom code execution one can dump SBK and forge keyblobs, and thus control the package1 key. 

Thus ('''in theory, but not in practice due to the size of the brute force required''') one can replace the package1 key with garbage, causing package1 to decrypt into garbage, and hope that this garbage passes validation checks and that package1ldr jumping into the garbage will do something useful.

This was fixed incidentally in [[6.2.0]], as pk1ldr does not use keyblob data to decrypt package1 any more.

|  With a large enough brute force: arbitrary package1 code execution from coldboot.

However, a usable brute force is on the order of >= ~2^80, so '''this is almost certainly not actually usable in any meaningful context'''.

|  Non-atomic mutexes
|  When an [[SMC]] is called, TrustZone sets a global variable to mark that an SMC is in progress, so that two SMCs using shared resources (like the security engine) do not trample on one another. On 1.0.0, this global variable was written using non-atomic writes, and thus a race condition is possible.

However, the SMC handler enforces that all SMCs must be called from core #3, unless the top-level handler ID is 1 (SMCs internal to the kernel). Thus, the only SMCs that can be run side-by-side are [any userland smc] and smcGetRandomBytesForKernel, and this turns out to not really be abusable.

|  jamais vu (non-secure world access to PMC MMIO and pre-deep sleep firmware)
|  On [[1.0.0]], one could map in the PMC registers in userland. In addition, [[AM_services|am]] ran a little-kernel based firmware on the BPMP at runtime. With code execution under am, one could modify the BPMP's little-kernel firmware to hook deep sleep entry, and modify TrustZone/Security engine state. 

This was fixed in [[2.0.0]] by making the PMC secure-world only, blacklisting the BPMP's exception vectors from being mapped, and thoroughly checking for malicious behavior on deep sleep entry.

|  Missed BPMP Exception Vector Writes
|  Starting in [[2.0.0]], the BPMP is asleep at runtime, and is turned on by TrustZone during [[SMC|smcCpuSuspend]] in order to initiate the deep sleep process. When it does so, it is held in RESET, and TrustZone attempts to write to the BPMP exception vectors at 0x6000F200 to register EVP_RESET = lp0_entry_fw_crt0, and all other EVPs to a function that simply reboots. However, while they successfully write EVP_RESET, they miss all the other vectors, accidentally writing to the 0x6000F004-0x6000F020 region instead of the 0x6000F204-0x6000F220 region they want to write to. This results in all the exception vectors for the BPMP other than RESET being "undefined" (attacker controlled).

With some way of causing an exception vector to be taken at the right time, this would give pre-sleep code execution (and thus arbitrary TrustZone code execution, via the security engine flaw). However, none of the abort vectors are really triggerable, and interrupts are disabled for the BPMP when it is taken out of reset. Thus, this is useless in practice.

This was fixed in [[4.0.0]] by writing to the correct registers.

|  TSEC has access to the secure kernel carveout 
|  TrustZone is responsible for managing security carveouts to prevent DMA controllers from accessing the carveout which contains the kernel, sysmodules, and other critical operating system data.

Until [[8.0.0]], the list of devices that could access the carveout included the TSEC. However, the TSEC can bypass the SMMU when in authenticated mode by writing to a certain register. Thus, pwning nvservices would allow one to take over the TSEC, and use it to write to normally protected mmio/memory.

In [[8.0.0]], this was fixed by removing TSEC access, and adding TSECB access (TSECB cannot bypass the SMMU).

|  deja vu (insufficient system state validation on suspend leads to pre-sleep BPMP code execution)
|  Jamais Vu was fixed in [[2.0.0]] by making the PMC secure-world only, blacklisting the BPMP's exception vectors from being mapped, and thoroughly checking for malicious behavior on deep sleep entry, since gaining pre-sleep code execution on the BPMP compromises the system.

However, the state validation performed by Nintendo's Secure Monitor was insufficient to prevent pre-sleep execution from being obtained.

Prior to [[6.0.0]], one could use a DMA controller that had access to IRAM and was not held in reset (there were multiple) to race TrustZone's writes to the BPMP firmware in IRAM, and thus overwrite Nintendo's firmware with an attacker's to gain pre-sleep code execution.

[[6.0.0]] addressed this by performing TrustZone state MAC writes and locking PMC scratch *before* turning on the BPMP, fixing the original Jamais Vu exploit entirely. In addition, the BPMP firmware in TrustZone's .rodata is now memcmp'd to the actual data after it is written to IRAM. This mitigates race attacks that modify the firmware.

However, Nintendo both forgot to validate the BPMP exception vectors after writing them, and forgot to hold in reset a DMA controller that can write to the BPMP's exception vectors.

AHB-DMA is not blacklisted by kernel mapping whitelist (Nintendo probably forgot it, because the TX1 TRM does not really document that it's present, although the MMIO works as documented in older (Tegra 3 and before) TRMs).

Thus, with kernel code execution (or some other way of accessing AHB-DMA, e.g. nspwn on <= 4.1.0, TSEC hax, or other arbitrary mmio access flaws), one can DMA to the BPMP's exception vectors as they are written, causing TrustZone to start the BPMP executing an attacker's firmware at a different location than TrustZone intends/validates.

This was fixed in [[8.0.0]] by blocking AHB-DMA arbitration and verifying it is held in reset during suspend, and thus there are no more devices that can write to the relevant MMIO at the right time.

Thus anyone with access to the spl: service (via smhax or by pwning a sysmodule with access) could do crypto with any access keys they knew.

| nspwn
| fsp-ldr command 0 "MountCode" takes in a Content Path (retrieved from NCM by Loader), and returns an IFileSystem for the resulting ExeFS. These content paths, are normally NCAs, but MountCode also supports a number of other formats, including ".nsp" -- which is just a PFS0.

When a path ending in ".nsp" is parsed by MountCode, the PFS0 is treated as a raw ExeFS. Because there is no NCA header, the ACID signatures are not validated -- and because there are no other signatures in a PFS0, this results in no signature checking happening at all.

The actual .nsp handling is eventually done by {content mounting function} called by MountCode and other FS commands.

Thus, by placing an ExeFS (NSOs + "main.npdm") and setting one's desired title ID to "@Sdcard:/some_title.nsp" or "@User:/some_title.nsp" etc one can launch arbitrary unsigned code, with arbitrary unsigned NPDMs.

This appears to have been fixed by only allowing .nsp when the input fstype==7 for the internal content-mounting function, returning 0x2EE202 otherwise.

| Single null-byte stack overflow in Loader ContentPath parsing

Thus, a content path of the maximum length (0x300 bytes) would result in strcat writing a NULL terminator past the end of the nca_path buffer.

This was fixed in [[6.0.0]], the new code looks like this:

|  OOB Read in NS system module (pl:utoohax, pl:utonium, maybe other names)
|  Prior to [[3.0.0]], pl:u (Shared Font services implemented in the NS sysmodule) service commands 1,2,3 took in a signed 32-bit index and returned that index of an array but did not check that index at all. This allowed for an arbitrary read within a 34-bit range (33-bit signed) from NS .bss. In [[3.0.0]], sending out of range indexes causes error code 0x60A to be returned.

| Unchecked domain ID in common IPC code
| Prior to [[2.0.0]], object IDs in [[IPC_Marshalling#Domain_message|domain messages]] are not bounds checked. This out-of-bounds read could be exploited to brute-force ASLR and get PC control in some services that support domain messages.

| expLDR (sysmodule handle table exhaustion)
| Most sysmodules share common template code to handle IPC control messages. The command DuplicateSession (type 5 command 2)'s template code will abort() if it fails to duplicate a session's handle for the requester. Because many sysmodules have limited handle table size (smaller than the browser/other entrypoints), repeatedly requesting to duplicate one's session will cause the sysmodule to run out of handle table space and abort, causing the service to release all its handles cleanly.
| Sysmodule crashes.  Most usefully, crashing ldr allows access to fsp-ldr and crashing pm allows access to fsp-pr. Useless after [[4.0.0]], which mitigated a number of single-session service access issues.

| Transfer Memory leak in nvservices system module
| The nvservices sysmodule does not clear most of its transfer memory prior to release.
| The calling process can read key bits of memory, including breaking ASLR (by revealing the image base) and exposing the address of other transfer memory to set up attacks.

| OOB write in audio system module
| Prior to [[2.0.0]], the [[Audio_services#audout:u|AppendAudioOutBuffer]] and [[Audio_services#audin:u|AppendAudioInBuffer]] IPC commands would blindly increment the appended buffers' count while using said count value as an index to where the user data should be copied into. This resulted in an 0x28 bytes, user controlled, out-of-bounds memory write into the [[Audio_services|audio]] sysmodule's memory space.
Combined with the [[Audio_services#audout:u|GetReleasedAudioOutBuffer]] or [[Audio_services#audin:u|GetReleasedAudioInBuffer]] commands, this could also be used as an 8 byte infoleak.

In [[2.0.0]], the commands now return error code 0x1099 if the number of unreleased buffers exceeds 0x1F.

| nvhax (memory corruption in nvservices system module)
| Prior to [[6.2.0]], the [[NV_services|nvservices]] ioctl [[NV_services#.2Fdev.2Fnvhost-ctrl-gpu|NVGPU_GPU_IOCTL_WAIT_FOR_PAUSE]] would take a single "pwarpstate" argument which would be interpreted by nvservices as a memory pointer for writing 2 "warpstate" structs (one for each Streaming Multiprocessor).
This resulted in nvservices attempting to blindly memcpy into this user supplied address and trigger a crash. However, if paired with an infoleak, this could be used to arbitrarily write 0x30 bytes anywhere in nvservices' memory space.
Additionally, the "warpstate" struct itself was never initialized, which means nvservices would leak the 0x30 bytes from the stack. By invoking other ioctls it was also possible to partially control the stack contents and achieve a usable arbitrary memory write primitive.

In [[6.2.0]], [[NV_services#.2Fdev.2Fnvhost-ctrl-gpu|NVGPU_GPU_IOCTL_WAIT_FOR_PAUSE]] now takes 2 inline "warpstate" structs instead of a "pwarpstate" pointer, thus effectively avoiding the bad memcpy.

| Infoleak in nvservices system module
| The [[NV_services|nvservices]] ioctl [[NV_services#NVMAP_IOC_ALLOC|NVMAP_IOC_ALLOC]] takes an optional argument "addr" which allows the calling process to pass a pointer to user allocated memory for backing a nvmap object. If "addr" is left as 0, nvservices uses the transfer memory region (donated by the user during initialization) instead, when allocating memory for the nvmap object.
By design, freeing the nvmap object by calling the ioctl [[NV_services#NVMAP_IOC_FREE|NVMAP_IOC_FREE]] returns, in its "refcount" argument, the user address previously supplied if the reference count reaches 0.
However, prior to [[6.2.0]], the case where the transfer memory region is used to allocate the nvmap object was not taken into account, thus resulting in [[NV_services#NVMAP_IOC_FREE|NVMAP_IOC_FREE]] leaking back an address from within the transfer memory region mapped in nvservices' memory space.

In [[6.2.0]], [[NV_services#NVMAP_IOC_FREE|NVMAP_IOC_FREE]] no longer returns the address when the transfer memory region is used instead of user supplied memory.
