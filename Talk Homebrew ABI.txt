== StdioSockets ==

Currently, there's a broken link in the [[Homebrew_ABI#Loader_Config_Keys|Loader Config Keys]] section on the StdioSockets key, caused by a [http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Homebrew_ABI&curid=284&diff=4772&oldid=3846 recent removal of the section]. I understand the temptation to remove StdioSockets, since it wasn't very well designed in the first place, and nobody uses it anymore, but I don't think that it makes sense to remove it from the ABI specification. The key shouldn't be erased entirely, because that would indicate that it is unreserved. A backwards-incompatible change like that defeats one of the purposes of the ABI. Removing the link and adding a label that the key is deprecated would be acceptable, but it'd leave no specification on the key. I think that, unless I'm misinterpreting the original intent of the edit, it should be reverted and labels should be added to the key's specification that it is deprecated and no longer in use.

Probably better to just reserve it for future use I guess. Had someone interrogate me about why nxlink didn't use the homebrew ABI "properly" so it seemed better to remove it rather than leave it there confusing people.
