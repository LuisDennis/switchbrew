## Move ports to Emulators/separate category

I believe that the ports (Cannonball, Postal, etc) should be moved to a
separate category or the emulators section

Hmm, I think you might be right about cannonball at least. However, a
ported game is still a game, same as a ported emulator is still an
emulator. Otherwise we would need to have the same logic for these, too.
