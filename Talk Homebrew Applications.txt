== Move ports to Emulators/separate category ==
I believe that the ports (Cannonball, Postal, etc) should be moved to a separate category or the emulators section

Hmm, I think you might be right about cannonball at least. However, a ported game is still a game, same as a ported emulator is still an emulator. Otherwise we would need to have the same logic for these, too.
