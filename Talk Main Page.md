## HTTPS Redirect

Currently, http traffic is not redirected to an https URL. Could the
site administrator please add such a redirect? The login page especially
should only be served over https, and on Firefox at least, the login
cookie does not get sent to pages loaded over http if you logged in over
https. --[Misson20000](User:Misson20000 "wikilink")
