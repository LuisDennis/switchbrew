## HTTPS Redirect

Currently, http traffic is not redirected to an https URL. Could the
site administrator please add such a redirect? The login page especially
should only be served over https, and on Firefox at least, the login
cookie does not get sent to pages loaded over http if you logged in over
https. --[Misson20000](User:Misson20000 "wikilink")

Sure, I can take a look into it. I've been wanting to add SSL certs on
the site for sometime now, but unfortunately my host doesn't allow me to
add a free one. I'm in the process of changing hosting provider, so when
that happens, I'll make these changes.

## Image Thumbnail Errors

The wiki is failing to create thumbnails for uploaded SVG images. See
[:File:C\_descriptor\_type\_2.svg](:File:C%20descriptor%20type%202.svg.md "wikilink").
It embeds like this:
![C\_descriptor\_type\_2.svg](C_descriptor_type_2.svg
"C_descriptor_type_2.svg"). PNG images do this too. See
[:File:C\_descriptor\_type\_2.png](:File:C%20descriptor%20type%202.png.md "wikilink").
