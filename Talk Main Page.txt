== HTTPS Redirect ==

Currently, http traffic is not redirected to an https URL. Could the site administrator please add such a redirect? The login page especially should only be served over https, and on Firefox at least, the login cookie does not get sent to pages loaded over http if you logged in over https.

Sure, I can take a look into it. I've been wanting to add SSL certs on the site for sometime now, but unfortunately my host doesn't allow me to add a free one. I'm in the process of changing hosting provider, so when that happens, I'll make these changes.
