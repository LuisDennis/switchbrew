lp1 refers to what environment is to be used, lp1 being retail (?). Using the following code we can perform a DNS enumeration to see what environments there are:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import socket
import string
import itertools
from multiprocessing import Pool


def check_env(env):
    try:
        socket.gethostbyname('sun.hac.{0}1.d4c.nintendo.net'.format(env[0]
                             + env[1]))
        return '{0}{1}1'.format(env[0], env[1])
    except:
        pass


def main():
    pool = Pool()
    potential_environments = itertools.product(string.lowercase,
            string.lowercase)

    results = pool.map(check_env, potential_environments)
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
    print set(results)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</pre>

Which in turn gives us the following:
dp1, sp1, lp1, td1, jd1. At some point we should try and see if we can find any references anywhere as to what each of these environments are. --[[User:FrasierCrane|FrasierCrane]] ([[User talk:FrasierCrane|talk]]) 15:53, 10 May 2018 (CDT)

:Just added some of these to the Network page. Is "dp1" accurate or did you mean "dd1"? Code mentions "dd1" only. --[[User:Hexkyz|Hexkyz]] ([[User talk:Hexkyz|talk]]) 16:07, 10 May 2018 (CDT)
