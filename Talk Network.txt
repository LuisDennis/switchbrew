lp1 refers to what environment is to be used, lp1 being retail (?). Using the following code we can perform a DNS enumeration to see what environments there are:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import socket
import string
import itertools
from multiprocessing import Pool


def check_env(env):
    try:
        socket.gethostbyname('sun.hac.{0}1.d4c.nintendo.net'.format(env[0]
                             + env[1]))
        return '{0}{1}1'.format(env[0], env[1])
    except:
        pass


def main():
    pool = Pool()
    potential_environments = itertools.product(string.lowercase,
            string.lowercase)

    results = pool.map(check_env, potential_environments)
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
    print set(results)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</pre>

Which in turn gives us the following:
dp1, sp1, lp1, td1, jd1. At some point we should try and see if we can find any references anywhere as to what each of these environments are. --[[User:FrasierCrane|FrasierCrane]] ([[User talk:FrasierCrane|talk]]) 15:53, 10 May 2018 (CDT)

:Just added some of these to the Network page. Is "dp1" accurate or did you mean "dd1"? Code mentions "dd1" only. --[[User:Hexkyz|Hexkyz]] ([[User talk:Hexkyz|talk]]) 16:07, 10 May 2018 (CDT)

: dp1 is correct. My theory is that the second character refers to either (p)roduction (retail unit) or (d)evelopment (SDEV units?). dp1 might be an internal retail unit testing backend for Nintendo. I can't work out the first characters meaning though, SciresM did a big post on reddit that explains some of it and gives other potential domains but, the first character is still a mystery. Here's all I can think for the first character:

d = Development (Third party developers?)
t = Testing (Nintendo Internal rather than third party?)
s = Lotcheck (How s = lotcheck, I don't know, SciresM reddit post does mention an s domain for lotcheck though.
l = Live (Retail)

: Small second note, if the code mentions dd1, by the previous running theory, that would mean it's third-party dev using developer unit.
