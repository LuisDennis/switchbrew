## Game Case IDs

I noticed there are two additional IDs for each game on the back of the
game case, on the bottom right. Should these be documented? Examples:

    Zelda BotW - HAC P AAAAA CAN | 105212A
    Disgaea 5  - HAC P AACAC     | DISS-SWI-US-VG

"CAN" is obviously Canada, but that might just be an ID to signify the
packaging and have nothing to do with the cartridge/contents. The
secondary ID is what has my interest. -[Ehm](User:Ehm "wikilink")
