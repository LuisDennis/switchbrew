## Game Case IDs

I noticed there are two additional IDs for each game on the back of the
game case, on the bottom right. Should these be documented? Examples:

    Zelda BotW - HAC P AAAAA CAN | 105212A
    Disgaea 5  - HAC P AACAC     | DISS-SWI-US-VG

"CAN" is obviously Canada, but that might just be an ID to signify the
packaging and have nothing to do with the cartridge/contents. The
secondary ID is what has my interest. -[Ehm](User:Ehm "wikilink")

    With previous Nintendo consoles, these don't directly represent the
    ROM and neither does the stuff on the front of the cart. For the
    actual info regarding the ROM, you needed to look at the back of the
    disc/cart. Not that the box stuff isn't worth noting though - and it
    may be a different scenario with the Switch.

        Cool. Looking into it more, some games don't even have a
        secondary ID. -[Ehm](User:Ehm "wikilink")
