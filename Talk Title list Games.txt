==Game Case IDs==
I noticed there are two additional IDs for each game on the back of the game case, on the bottom right. Should these be documented? Examples:
<pre>
Zelda BotW - HAC P AAAAA CAN | 105212A
Disgaea 5  - HAC P AACAC     | DISS-SWI-US-VG
</pre>
"CAN" is obviously Canada, but that might just be an ID to signify the packaging and have nothing to do with the cartridge/contents. The secondary ID is what has my interest. -[[User:Ehm|Ehm]] ([[User talk:Ehm|talk]]) 18:30, 10 June 2017 (CDT)
