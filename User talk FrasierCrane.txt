Where did that info come from? --[[User:Yellows8|Yellows8]] ([[User talk:Yellows8|talk]]) 01:29, 10 May 2018 (CDT)

A lot of fuzzing and time spent in IDA. Or are you asking for where to look for yourself?
:So ".api_info" / NPDM info isn't from official SDK, right? --[[User:Yellows8|Yellows8]] ([[User talk:Yellows8|talk]]) 12:12, 10 May 2018 (CDT)

:.api_info is found in older non-nintendo (games) applications when unpacked from an NSO back to an ELF. I'm not really sure what it is, static compilation of the SDK? Wouldn't the be stripped for published games? Nothing post-6 months of NX release appears to have it. NPDM info has been determined very lazily, a lot of modifying the hbmenu generated one and poking at where Horizon breaks or where any odd behavior happens, as well as comparison to some official NPDM files. If I have gotten anything wrong and someone knows better, well, that's what the collaborative process of a wiki is for. Are reversing officially released titles are fair game? If not, I'll remove my changes. --[[User:FrasierCrane|FrasierCrane]] ([[User talk:FrasierCrane|talk]]) 12:26, 10 May 2018 (CDT)
::"Are reversing officially released titles are fair game?" Yeah that's fine. --[[User:Yellows8|Yellows8]] ([[User talk:Yellows8|talk]]) 12:33, 10 May 2018 (CDT)
:: Good to know. Working out those last pieces were very difficult so that might be the last of my contributions. I hope it saves you all some time with your future work. Thank you for everything you've contributed and paving the way for third parties like myself to assist where possible. --[[User:FrasierCrane|FrasierCrane]] ([[User talk:FrasierCrane|talk]]) 15:00, 10 May 2018 (CDT)
