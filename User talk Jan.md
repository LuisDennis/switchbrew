Please don't add VS Code instructions to the wiki.

There are plans to add a custom Code::Blocks to the packages supplied
via pacman with included project templates. Adding instructions for one
editor will lead to instructions for other editors and, in the end,
everybody gets confused & we start editor wars. It's very tedious and
frustrating.

The included msys2 is optional and may not be installed at the specified
path. It's also not installed on OSX or Linux.

Ultimately it's best to try & standardise rather than try to cover every
possible choice.
