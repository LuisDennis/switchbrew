Regarding [http://switchbrew.org/index.php?curid=135&diff=995&oldid=993 this]: are you using a DNS-server wtih dauth already blocked, or everything non-conntest blocked? --[[User:Yellows8|Yellows8]] ([[User talk:Yellows8|talk]]) 13:31, 21 June 2017 (CDT)
:Ah shoot, I had everything redirected without any domain cherry-picking, though the way it was phrased made it sound like the WebKit component was blocked by dauth when the message could only possibly show up after the portal, realistically. --[[User:Shinyquagsire23|Shinyquagsire23]] ([[User talk:Shinyquagsire23|talk]]) 14:14, 21 June 2017 (CDT)
